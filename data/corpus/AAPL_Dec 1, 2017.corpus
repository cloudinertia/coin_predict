stocks have generally outperformed the broader stock market this year but some tech companies have done better than others Tencent and Alibaba both Chinese companies are among the best performers while Jack Dorsey's Square more than doubled in the past year Tech stocks have been particular standouts this year as the infamous FANG stocks - Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google - have all posted gains of at least 30% double the 15% growth of the S&P 500 The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 posted a gain of 29 37% so far this year But the FANG stocks however impressive their growth aren't the biggest standouts in the tech sector A handful of companies have posted gains that far outpace the likes of Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix and Google this year Of the FANG stocks Netflix is the best performing It grew 46 98% so far this year but was matched by Salesforce and pales in comparison to Square's 232% growth Andy Kiersz / Business Insider Here are some notable tech companies that have outperformed the big-name FANG stocks in order of performance Salesforce (CRM) +48% to $104 42 Salesforce doesn't wield the same name recognition as Netflix or Facebook but the cloud software company has been outperforming under the watch of CEO Marc Benioff Benioff has said he hopes to grow his company's revenue to $20 billion by 2022 which would be nearly double the $10 35 billion it expects to rake in this year Benioff already announced that he expects 20% revenue growth next year Nvidia (NVDA) +93 72% to $197 52 Artificial intelligence has exploded in popularity this year and Nvidia has positioned itself extremely well for the coming AI revolution Nvidia's graphics cards are used to speed up the training of AI systems and are being added to data centers across the globe to aid in the influx of AI research It also helps that mining cryptocurrencies like ethereum can be sped up with the addition of Nvidia's cards Alibaba (BABA) +99 22% to $176 74 Alibaba is often called the Amazon of China and the e-commerce company has started to expand its reach abroad Perhaps the best illustration of Alibaba's strength comes from its recent Singles Day where one day of sales pulled in more than $25 billion Amazon's comparable Prime Day event brought in about $1 billion this year Tencent (Traded in the US as an ADR) +100 04% to $48 60 In early November Tencent surpassed Facebook in terms of market cap and became the first Asian company worth more than $500 billion Tencent's biggest product is WeChat which is the dominant social media ecosystem in China The company also has a powerful digital payments platform baked into many of its services Recent declines have put Tencent back below Facebook in size but the company's growth for the year is still impressive Square (SQ) +172 77%
