dollar denominated debt during the quarter bringing us to $104 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding How much the company decides to repatriate is anyone’s guess Yet we believe a methodical strategy beginning with paying down some or all of its $100bn in debt it issued (almost precisely because Apple did not want to pay high taxes on any cash it has repatriated up until now) could strengthen the company’s financial position and provide a boon for shareholders going forward After the debt situation is addressed we expect the company to address its capital return program Again here’s Cook here’s Cook We also returned $11 billion to investors during the quarter We paid $3 3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4 5 billion on repurchases of 29 1 million Apple shares through open market transactions We also launched a new $3 billion ASR program resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15 1 million shares and we retire 4 5 million shares upon the completion of our 11th ASR during the quarter We have now completed almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program including $166 billion in share repurchases We also returned

We have now completed almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program including $166 billion in share repurchases The company has repurchased $166bn worth of its own stock We urge this fact to be viewed in a simple context the share price has risen considerably throughout 2017 The stock price is no longer as cheap as it once was And to cite Warren Buffett a large shareholder of Apple himself cite Warren Buffett For continuing shareholders repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price below intrinsic value When that rule is followed the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic value Consider a simple analogy If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3 000 and one is bought out by the partnership for $900 each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50 If the exiting partner is paid $1 100 however the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50 The same math applies with corporations and their shareholders Ergo the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or value-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent… It is puzzling therefore that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above which repurchases will be eschewed That certainly wouldn't be the case if a management was buying an outside business For

refer to a price above which repurchases will be eschewed Certainly there should be some point where the stock price no longer justifies the company’s buyback – we argue that this threshold has long been passed S&P companies have seen the writing on the wall Share buybacks have slowed as valuations (read stock prices) have continued to march higher throughout this bull market We urge Apple to avoid the pitfalls of buybacks last time overseas revenues were repatriated in 2004 where most companies did little to benefit their companies long term rather they simply bought back tons of stock have slowed where most companies did little to benefit their companies long term Instead we have called on the company to focus on other uses of cash upon repatriation rather than buying back more shares Investors are to be watchful of a potential special dividend as Apple stands to benefit from repatriation as much as any other company in the world Some analyses are coming out citing a potential $15-$20 per share at a cost of upwards of $100bn something easily achievable once $250bn has returned from overseas Some analyses Alternatively raising its dividend to a higher % while benefitting large shareholders like Buffett and Cook is another downpayment on its confidence in the iPhone landscape It will also mitigate any potential shock to the stock upon a potential announcement that it would no longer be repurchasing such a large amount of shares While normally such a press release would be viewed as a negative if it is coupled with a dividend raise or a special dividend the impact would surely be buffered Conclusion Now more than ever is the time for Apple to ready the market by tempering expectations of a significant increase in its share repurchase program Apple should embark on strategies that are intended to grow the earnings – acquisitions sensible capital deployments investments in its supply chain – instead of strategies like buybacks intended to inflate EPS under the guise of value The prospect of a special dividend is really only on the table because Apple could retire its entire debt load pay its taxes invest in its business and still have billions left over Navigating the 2017 repatriation waters will dictate Apple’s strategy for years to come Disclosure I am/we are long AAPL Disclosure I am/we are long AAPL I wrote this article myself
