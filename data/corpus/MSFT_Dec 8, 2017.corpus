About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) David Zanoni Momentum growth at reasonable price long-term horizon Momentum at a Reasonable Price (4 278 followers) Summary Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit The House and Senate tax reform bills both contain plans to repatriate money that U S based companies hold overseas So the final bill is likely to contain tax reform to encourage money held overseas to be brought back to the United States Microsoft (MSFT) has $128 billion overseas Bringing this back to the U S can be good for the company and shareholders The money held overseas is not used for paying dividends expanding U S operations share buybacks etc without large tax penalties Building repatriation of corporate money held overseas into tax reform will encourage this money to come back to the U S to help Microsoft and other companies in similar situations If Microsoft brought the $128 billion back to the U S the company would most likely use it for some of the same things that they’re currently doing Using some of it to pay dividends is a likely use of the money This could be in the form of increased payments for future quarters The company also could consider paying a special dividend on top of the regular payments Boosting dividends in whatever form would attract investors looking for yield That could create more demand for the stock putting positive upward pressure on the price Microsoft also has been active with share repurchases The last share repurchase authorization was made in September 2016 for $40 billion Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for a new stock buyback authorization The share repurchases will help boost EPS by reducing the amount of shares outstanding This has the opposite effect of share dilution where offering new shares tends to put negative pressure on stock prices So ongoing share repurchases can help put positive pressure on the stock by reducing dilution thus making existing shares more valuable for shareholders Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for expanding current businesses The company could leverage their strengths by putting more money into their most successful businesses More investments could be put into the growth segments Productivity and Business Processes (the segment that includes LinkedIn) and Intelligent Cloud to leverage the company’s growth One possible area of spending for repatriated money is for data centers Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood indicated in the recent Wells Fargo Tech Summit that Microsoft’s largest capital spending is for data centers The data centers need to be placed where customers need them Therefore repatriated cash provides more funds to allocate towards data centers which would ultimately improve customer service Repatriated cash also can be used for acquisitions Microsoft will have more money available for strategic growth building acquisitions The company is likely to continue their ongoing strategy of finding other related businesses to grow the company like they did with the LinkedIn acquisition Having more cash available for acquisitions provides a cheaper way to pay as opposed to financing which would add to debt The Story of Microsoft’s Valuation Before the LinkedIn acquisition and the cloud business (Azure) Microsoft was a low-multiple tech stock Low multiple tech stocks are mature companies where their previous high growth slows down to below average single-digit earnings growth levels The lower growth typically lowers the PE ratios and other valuation metrics to average or below average levels Azure and LinkedIn transformed Microsoft back into a higher-growth company with double-digit earnings growth Microsoft is expected to grow earnings between 11% and 12% in FY19 (consensus) The market is giving Microsoft an above average valuation with a forward PE of about 22 as compared to the S&P 500’s (SPY) forward PE of nearly 20 Investors are giving Microsoft a slight premium valuation for its double-digit growth and for their dividends (current yield of 2%) The earnings growth will allow the company to increase the dividend payments over time while driving the stock price higher With a forward PE of 22 Microsoft is trading below Automatic Data Processing (ADP) which has a forward PE of 26 8 and is expected growth of 10% to 11% next year I compared Microsoft to ADP because they have the next highest market cap after Microsoft in the Business and Software/Services industry Microsoft is trading at the industry’s average which also has a forward PE of 22 I see this as a reasonable valuation for a company growing earnings at a double-digit pace in this phase of the bull market Outlook for Microsoft’s Stock Repatriated money is likely to make its way back into Microsoft’s business in various forms This could be in the form of dividend increases share repurchases and the expansion of current businesses If the company finds a good fit repatriated cash also can help secure a new acquisition Overall I expect repatriated cash to strengthen Microsoft as an investment Considering Microsoft’s valuation at a reasonable level considering its dividend yield and growth rate I expect the stock to grow at about 12% over the next year I think the stock will be driven by earnings growth while the PE remains relatively stable This will take the stock to about $94 by the end of 2018 Let me know what you think in the comment

tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit Summary Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if

encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit The House and Senate tax reform bills both contain plans to repatriate money that U S based companies hold overseas So the final bill is likely to contain tax reform to encourage money held overseas to be brought back to the United States Microsoft (MSFT) has $128 billion overseas Bringing this back to the U S can be good for the company and shareholders The money held overseas is not used for paying dividends expanding U S operations share buybacks etc without large tax penalties Building repatriation of corporate money held overseas into tax reform will encourage this money to come back to the U S to help Microsoft and other companies in similar situations If Microsoft brought the $128 billion back to the U S the company would most likely use it for some of the same things that they’re currently doing Using some of it to pay dividends is a likely use of the money This could be in the form of increased payments for future quarters The company also could consider paying a special dividend on top of the regular payments Boosting dividends in whatever form would attract investors looking for yield That could create more demand for the stock putting positive upward pressure on the price Microsoft also has been active with share repurchases The last share repurchase authorization was made in September 2016 for $40 billion Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for a new stock buyback authorization The share repurchases will help boost EPS by reducing the amount of shares outstanding This has the opposite effect of share dilution where offering new shares tends to put negative pressure on stock prices So ongoing share repurchases can help put positive pressure on the stock by reducing dilution thus making existing shares more valuable for shareholders Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for expanding current businesses The company could leverage their strengths by putting more money into their most successful businesses More investments could be put into the growth segments Productivity and Business Processes (the segment that includes LinkedIn) and Intelligent Cloud to leverage the company’s growth One possible area of spending for repatriated money is for data centers Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood indicated in the recent Wells Fargo Tech Summit that Microsoft’s largest capital spending is for data centers The data centers need to be placed where customers need them Therefore repatriated cash provides more funds to allocate towards data centers which would ultimately improve customer service Repatriated cash also can be used for acquisitions Microsoft will have more money available for strategic growth building acquisitions The company is likely to continue their ongoing strategy of finding other related businesses to grow the company like they did with the LinkedIn acquisition Having more cash available for acquisitions provides a cheaper way to pay as opposed to financing which would add to debt The Story of Microsoft’s Valuation Before the LinkedIn acquisition and the cloud business (Azure) Microsoft was a low-multiple tech stock Low multiple tech stocks are mature companies where their previous high growth slows down to below average single-digit earnings growth levels The lower growth typically lowers the PE ratios and other valuation metrics to average or below average levels Azure and LinkedIn transformed Microsoft back into a higher-growth company with double-digit earnings growth Microsoft is expected to grow earnings between 11% and 12% in FY19 (consensus) The market is giving Microsoft an above average valuation with a forward PE of about 22 as compared to the S&P 500’s (SPY) forward PE of nearly 20 Investors are giving Microsoft a slight premium valuation for its double-digit growth and for their dividends (current yield of 2%) The earnings growth will allow the company to increase the dividend payments over time while driving the stock price higher With a forward PE of 22 Microsoft is trading below Automatic Data Processing (ADP) which has a forward PE of 26 8 and is expected growth of 10% to 11% next year I compared Microsoft to ADP because they have the next highest market cap after Microsoft in the Business and Software/Services industry Microsoft is trading at the industry’s average which also has a forward PE of 22 I see this as a reasonable valuation for a company growing earnings at a double-digit pace in this phase of the bull market Outlook for Microsoft’s Stock Repatriated money is likely to make its way back into Microsoft’s business in various forms This could be in the form of dividend increases share repurchases and the expansion of current businesses If the company finds a good fit repatriated cash also can help secure a new acquisition Overall I expect repatriated cash to strengthen Microsoft as an investment Considering Microsoft’s valuation at a reasonable level considering its dividend yield and growth rate I expect the stock to grow at about 12% over the next year I think the stock will be driven by earnings growth while the PE remains relatively stable
