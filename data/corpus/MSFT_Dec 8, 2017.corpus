17 | About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) David Zanoni Momentum growth at reasonable price long-term horizon Momentum at a Reasonable Price (4 278 followers) Summary Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit The House and Senate tax reform bills both contain plans to repatriate money that U S based companies hold overseas So the final bill is likely to contain tax reform to encourage money held overseas to be brought back to the United States Microsoft (MSFT) has $128 billion overseas Bringing this back to the U S can be good for the company and shareholders The money held overseas is not used for paying dividends expanding U S operations share buybacks etc without large tax penalties Building repatriation of corporate money held overseas into tax reform will encourage this money to come back to the U S to help Microsoft and other companies in similar situations If Microsoft brought the $128 billion back to the U S the company would most likely use it for some of the same things that they’re currently doing Using some of it to pay dividends is a likely use of the money This could be in the form of increased payments for future quarters The company also could consider paying a special dividend on top of the regular payments Boosting dividends in whatever form would attract investors looking for yield That could create more demand for the stock putting positive upward pressure on the price Microsoft also has been active with share repurchases The last share repurchase authorization was made in September 2016 for $40 billion Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for a new stock buyback authorization The share repurchases will help boost EPS by reducing the amount of shares outstanding This has the opposite effect of share dilution where offering new shares tends to put negative pressure on stock prices So ongoing share repurchases can help put positive pressure on the stock by reducing dilution thus making existing shares more valuable for shareholders Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for expanding current businesses The company could leverage their strengths by putting more money into their most successful businesses More investments could be put into the growth segments Productivity and Business Processes (the segment that includes LinkedIn) and Intelligent Cloud to leverage the company’s growth One possible area of spending for repatriated money is for data centers Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood indicated in the recent Wells Fargo Tech Summit that Microsoft’s largest capital spending is for data centers The data centers need to be placed where customers need them Therefore repatriated cash provides more funds to allocate towards data centers which would ultimately improve customer service Repatriated cash also can be used for acquisitions Microsoft will have more money available for strategic growth building acquisitions The company is likely to continue their ongoing strategy of finding other related businesses to grow the company like they did with the LinkedIn acquisition Having more cash available for acquisitions provides a cheaper way to pay as opposed to financing which would add to debt The Story of Microsoft’s Valuation Before the LinkedIn acquisition and the cloud business (Azure) Microsoft was a low-multiple tech stock Low multiple tech stocks are mature companies where their previous high growth slows down to below average single-digit earnings growth levels The lower growth typically lowers the PE ratios and other valuation metrics to average or below average levels Azure and LinkedIn transformed Microsoft back into a higher-growth company with double-digit earnings growth Microsoft is expected to grow earnings between 11% and 12% in FY19 (consensus) The market is giving Microsoft an above average valuation with a forward PE of about 22 as compared to the S&P 500’s (SPY) forward PE of nearly 20 Investors are giving Microsoft a slight premium valuation for its double-digit growth and for their dividends (current yield of 2%) The earnings growth will allow the company to increase the dividend payments over time while driving the stock price higher With a forward PE of 22 Microsoft is trading below Automatic Data Processing (ADP) which has a forward PE of 26 8 and is expected growth of 10% to 11% next year I compared Microsoft to ADP because they have the next highest market cap after Microsoft in the Business and Software/Services industry Microsoft is trading at the industry’s average which also has a forward PE of 22 I see this as a reasonable valuation for a company growing earnings at a double-digit pace in this phase of the bull market Outlook for Microsoft’s Stock Repatriated money is likely to make its way back into Microsoft’s business in various forms This could be in the form of dividend increases share repurchases and the expansion of current businesses If the company finds a good fit repatriated cash also can help secure a new acquisition Overall I expect repatriated cash to strengthen Microsoft as an investment Considering Microsoft’s valuation at a reasonable level considering its dividend yield and growth rate I expect the stock to grow at about 12% over the next year I think the stock will be driven by earnings growth while the PE remains relatively stable This will take the stock to about $94 by the end of 2018 Let me know what you think in the comment

cash to strengthen Microsoft as an investment Considering Microsoft’s valuation at a reasonable level considering its dividend yield and growth rate I expect the stock to grow at about 12% over the next year I think the stock will be driven by earnings growth while the PE remains relatively stable This will take the stock to about $94 by the end of 2018 Let me know what you think in the comment section below If you like my analysis click on FOLLOW at the top of the article near my name That will allow my articles to display on your homepage as they are published About this article Expand Summary Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit Summary Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit Summary Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit Microsoft has $128 billion in cash overseas New tax reform (if passed) would encourage that money to come back to the U S Microsoft and shareholders are likely to benefit The House and Senate tax reform bills both contain plans to repatriate money that U S based companies hold overseas So the final bill is likely to contain tax reform to encourage money held overseas to be brought back to the United States Microsoft (MSFT) has $128 billion overseas Bringing this back to the U S can be good for the company and shareholders The money held overseas is not used for paying dividends expanding U S operations share buybacks etc without large tax penalties Building repatriation of corporate money held overseas into tax reform will encourage this money to come back to the U S to help Microsoft and other companies in similar situations If Microsoft brought the $128 billion back to the U S the company would most likely use it for some of the same things that they’re currently doing Using some of it to pay dividends is a likely use of the money This could be in the form of increased payments for future quarters The company also could consider paying a special dividend on top of the regular payments Boosting dividends in whatever form would attract investors looking for yield That could create more demand for the stock putting positive upward pressure on the price Microsoft also has been active with share repurchases The last share repurchase authorization was made in September 2016 for $40 billion Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for a new stock buyback authorization The share repurchases will help boost EPS by reducing the amount of shares outstanding This has the opposite effect of share dilution where offering new shares tends to put negative pressure on stock prices So ongoing share repurchases can help put positive pressure on the stock by reducing dilution thus making existing shares more valuable for shareholders Microsoft could use some of the repatriated money for expanding current businesses The company could leverage their strengths by putting more money into their most successful businesses More investments could be put into the growth segments Productivity and Business Processes (the segment that includes LinkedIn) and Intelligent Cloud to leverage the company’s growth One possible area of spending for repatriated money is for data centers Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood indicated in the recent Wells Fargo Tech Summit that Microsoft’s largest capital spending is for data centers The data centers need to be placed where customers need them Therefore repatriated cash provides more funds to allocate towards data centers which would ultimately improve customer service Repatriated cash also can be used for acquisitions Microsoft will have more money available for strategic growth building acquisitions The company is likely to continue their ongoing strategy of finding other related businesses to grow the company like they did with the LinkedIn acquisition Having more cash available for acquisitions provides a cheaper way to pay as opposed to financing which would add to debt The Story of Microsoft’s Valuation Before the LinkedIn acquisition and the cloud business (Azure) Microsoft was a low-multiple tech stock Low multiple tech stocks are mature companies where their previous high growth slows down to below average single-digit earnings growth levels The lower growth typically lowers the PE ratios and other valuation metrics to average or below average levels Azure and LinkedIn transformed Microsoft back into a higher-growth company with double-digit earnings growth Microsoft is expected to grow earnings between 11% and 12% in FY19 (consensus) The market is giving Microsoft an above average valuation with a forward PE of about 22 as compared to the S&P 500’s (SPY) forward PE of nearly 20 Investors are giving Microsoft a slight premium valuation for its double-digit growth and for their dividends (current yield of 2%) The earnings growth will allow the company to increase the dividend payments over time while driving the stock price higher With a forward PE of 22 Microsoft is trading below Automatic Data Processing (ADP) which has a forward PE of 26 8 and is expected growth of 10% to 11% next year I compared Microsoft to ADP because they have the next highest market cap after Microsoft in the Business and Software/Services industry Microsoft is trading at the industry’s average which also has a forward PE of 22 I see this as a reasonable valuation for a company growing earnings at a double-digit pace in this phase of

what may be its biggest profit machine yet (MSFT) Kimberly Chin Dec 8 2017 12 33 PM REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Microsoft plans to expand its margins in its cloud-computing-services business The Azure cloud-computing platform is said to drive much of Microsoft's revenue growth in the next five years according to UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe Microsoft is expected to rake in over $50 billion in sales over the next five years Watch Microsoft's real-time stock price here Microsoft may be upping investment in its biggest profit machine the Azure cloud-computing service Jennifer Swanson Lowe a UBS analyst said She sees Microsoft's cloud-computing services adding $57 billion in revenue over the next five years with $23 billion of that coming from Azure alone Lowe has a price target of $105 for the stock representing a 27 29% increase from its current level Companies are moving toward a so-called "digital transformation " whereby they adopt technologies in order to stay relevant or ahead of the competition Lowe sees upside for Microsoft's Azure because more companies and individuals will eventually move towards the cloud In October the company reported its commercial-cloud business hit $20 billion in annualized revenue a milestone that it was hoping to reach in 2018 due to Azure and its Office 365 productivity suite which both operate under the cloud Microsoft is up 1 67% on

looks like a winner ByJerry Kronenberg Dec 8 2017 1 02 PM EST Advertisement 0 26 Jim Cramer Loves Microsoft for 2018 and Beyond Jim Cramer recently bought shares of Microsoft (MSFT - Get Report) for his charitable trust and he likes the software giant's prospects for 2018 and beyond "We dipped our toes in this position in the tech sell-off shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday and we used [the market's recent] rotation out of tech to scale deeper into this classic tech name We like [Microsoft] as we head into 2018 and for the next few years " Cramer said in an exclusive conference call with members of his Action Alerts PLUS club for investors The stockpicker said Microsoft looks like a winner in several areas including Cloud Computing Cramer said that MSFT has "more data-center regions around the globe compared Amazon (AMZN - Get Report) and Alphabet (GOOG - Get Report) (GOOGL - Get Report) combined [This] global footprint is a key factor in our [investment] thesis as it allows Microsoft to offer companies a solution to security concerns related to hosting domestic-user data abroad and allows companies to be physically closer to their data thus reducing access time " Traditional Software Microsoft "has a very strong productive and business-processes segment -- think Windows Office 365 Dynamics 365 " he said LinkedIn Cramer said MSFT's 2016 acquisition of business-networking site LinkedIn com "is looking like a pretty good one This social-acquisition-network platform has achieved four consecutive quarters of [20%+] session growth and the platform's seeing record levels of engagement " Microsoft purchased business-networking site LinkedIn in late 2016 Xbox Microsoft has said its new Xbox One X is "off to a very strong start " the expert said Potential Cash Repatriation Cramer said Microsoft recently reported $132 billion of cash cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries that are eligible for repatriation to America if Trump administration plans for favorable tax treatment pass Congress "By bringing these dollars back home Microsoft can use the windfall to double down on its investment to data-center and other business areas [and] return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks " he said Want to join in on Jim's monthly conference calls?

Report) for his charitable trust and he likes the software giant's prospects for 2018 and beyond "We dipped our toes in this position in the tech sell-off shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday and we used [the market's recent] rotation out of tech to scale deeper into this classic tech name We like [Microsoft] as we head into 2018 and for the next few years " Cramer said in an exclusive conference call with members of his Action Alerts PLUS club for investors The stockpicker said Microsoft looks like a winner in several areas including Cloud Computing Cramer said that MSFT has "more data-center regions around the globe compared Amazon (AMZN - Get Report) and Alphabet (GOOG - Get Report) (GOOGL - Get Report) combined [This] global footprint is a key factor in our [investment] thesis as it allows Microsoft to offer companies a solution to security concerns related to hosting domestic-user data abroad and allows companies to be physically closer to their data thus reducing access time " Traditional Software Microsoft "has a very strong productive and business-processes segment -- think Windows Office 365 Dynamics 365 " he said LinkedIn Cramer said MSFT's 2016 acquisition of business-networking site LinkedIn com "is looking like a pretty good one This social-acquisition-network platform has achieved four consecutive quarters of [20%+] session growth and the platform's

America if Trump administration plans for favorable tax treatment pass Congress "By bringing these dollars back home Microsoft can use the windfall to double down on its investment to data-center and other business areas [and] return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks " he said Want to join in on Jim's monthly conference calls?

MARKETS-Stocks dollar climb after strong U S job growth data (MSFT) Reuters Dec 8 2017 02 57 PM * European stocks rally on Brexit talk breakthrough * After dramatic gains bitcoin tumbles 20 pct in 10 hours * Oil gains on Chinese demand but weekly losses loom * Dollar index on pace for fifth session of gains (Updates with afternoon trading) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK Dec 8 (Reuters) - Wall Street and other major global stock markets rose on Friday and the U S dollar was on pace for its fifth day of gains after data showed robust U S job growth The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0 74 percent supported by news that Britain and the European Union had a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations U S jobs grew at a strong clip in November even though the wage gains that could fuel inflation remain moderate The U S jobs report followed encouraging economic data from China and Japan that buoyed Asian shares “We have a continuation of an economy that has been pretty firm and pretty balanced for the better part of the last several years and that’s been good for stock prices ” said Jason Ware chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City “What we are seeing are yields under control and stocks doing well but the report was strong enough to suggest a bit of a bump in the dollar ” Ware said The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 74 points or 0 31 percent to 24 285 48 the S&P 500 gained 9 82 points or 0 37 percent to 2 646 8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21 67 points or 0 32 percent to 6 834 51 Technology stocks such as Microsoft and Oracle helped pace the advance building on the rebound from the selloff in the sector earlier in the week MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0 47 percent Investors also are continuing to watch a U S tax bill moving through Congress that will slash corporate levies and may have been relieved that U S lawmakers late on Thursday agreed to a temporary funding bill that averted a government shutdown U S President Donald Trump on Friday signed the legislation to fund the federal government for two weeks "Investors are also taking comfort from the lack of surprise from Washington with the House and the Senate passing continuing resolution " said Eric Wiegand senior portfolio manager at U S Bank's Private Client Reserve unit In Europe the banks index jumped 2 2 percent after financial regulators reached a long-sought deal on Thursday to harmonize global banking rules The dollar rose against the euro and yen in choppy trading after the U S jobs data but gains were capped by wages data that analysts said were disappointing The dollar index rose 0 11 percent with the euro down 0 04 percent to $1 1766 "The wages data reinforces the belief that inflationary pressures remain well-contained keeping the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening plans in check " said Karl Schamotta director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto The U S Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its Dec 12-13 policy meeting but Friday's jobs report could shape debate on monetary policy next year Bitcoin lost almost a fifth of its value in 10 hours on Friday having surged more than 40 percent in the preceding 48 hours sparking fears the market may be heading for a price collapse U S Treasury yields were little changed after the closely watched jobs report Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2 3796 percent from 2 376 percent late on Thursday Oil prices rose helped by Chinese crude demand and threats of a strike in Africa's largest oil exporter U S crude rose 1 09 percent to $57 31 per barrel and Brent was last at $63 33 up 1 82 percent on the day (Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York and Sruthi
