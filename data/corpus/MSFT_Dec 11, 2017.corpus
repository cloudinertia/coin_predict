About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Jonathan Weber Value dividend investing Growth growth at reasonable price (7 559 followers) Summary Evercore ISI made a very aggressive prediction Microsoft's valuation is unlikely to hit $1 trillion any time soon partially due to the impact of share repurchases Microsoft nevertheless should provide solid returns going forward Shares of Microsoft look attractive from a risk-reward view point Article thesis Some analysts believe that Microsoft's (MSFT) market capitalization could reach $1 trillion by 2020 which is far too aggressive I think Even without this happening Microsoft's shareholders should see solid returns over the coming years which makes Microsoft's shares worthy of a closer look from a risk-reward view point Why a trillion dollar market capitalization seems unrealistic Evercore ISI analysts have claimed that Microsoft's market capitalization could reach $1 trillion by 2020 i e in a little bit more than two years (they also stated that this could happen even before 2020) MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts In this YCharts graph we see that Microsoft is currently valued at just shy of $650 billion which means that its market capitalization would have to rise by roughly 54% through 2020 for Evercore ISI's prediction to come true This does not however mean that Microsoft's share price would have to rise by only 54%

come true This does not however mean that Microsoft's share price would have to rise by only 54% too source Microsoft's Annual Form 10-K source Microsoft's Annual Form 10-K Annual Form 10-K In Microsoft's annual report we see that the share count has dropped significantly over the last two years from 8 25 billion in 2015 to 7 83 billion in 2017 If we assume that the pace of share repurchases remains the same over the coming years the share count would average 7 20 billion shares in 2020 If Microsoft's market capitalization were to hit $1 trillion in 2020 Microsoft's share price would thus have to rise to $139 ($1 trillion in market cap divided by 7 2 billion shares) MSFT data by YCharts MSFT YCharts We see that Microsoft's share price is around $84 right now which means that shares would have to rally about 65% from the current level in order to hit the $139 price target that would be required in order to bring the company's market capitalization to the trillion dollar level Microsoft's shares have been rising substantially over the last couple of years as the company's mobile and cloud focus started to pay off and as Office 365 gained traction but assuming that shares would rise by more than sixty percent through 2020 when we basically are entering 2018 already seems too ambitious MSFT EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts MSFT EPS LT Growth Estimates YCharts Microsoft is currently trading at 24 8 times this year's expected earnings (meaning Microsoft's FY 2018 which started in July and ends June 2018) which is not a low valuation at all -- Microsoft has been trading at substantially lower multiples for many years But even when we assume that Microsoft's valuation multiple does not contract at all over the coming years the estimated EPS growth rates would not justify a $139 share price When we assume that Microsoft's EPS does indeed grow by 11 9% annually over the coming years (as analysts are forecasting right now) and that Microsoft hits the estimated $3 39 in EPS in its current financial year then Microsoft will earn $4 24 in FY 2020 -- shares would have to trade at 32 8 times earnings by 2020 in order to get to the $139 share price that would be needed for the company's valuation to breach $1 trillion Microsoft is showing solid earnings growth and is a key player in the cloud market but it seems too aggressive to assume that the company's valuation will explode to well above a thirty times earnings multiple especially as it is questionable whether the broad bull market we have seen over the last quarters will persist through the coming years Even without a trillion dollar valuation Microsoft is attractive though My belief that Microsoft will not breach the trillion dollar mark in 2020 does not mean that I believe that the company's shares are unattractive though Microsoft will likely deliver solid returns going forward and that makes shares worthy of a closer look as Microsoft is a low-risk investment source Microsoft's Annual Form 10-K source Microsoft's Annual Form 10-K Annual Form 10-K In its annual report Microsoft highlights some of the risks it faces but at the same time the phrasing shows why Microsoft is in a key position to benefit in the future Providers of successful ecosystems (such as Microsoft) have a big moat versus newcomers as networking effects make it hard for customers to switch to a competitors' offerings -- that's why Microsoft's Windows was is and very likely will be the dominant leader in operating systems globally source netmarketshare com source netmarketshare com netmarketshare com Windows holds a 89% market share among operating systems up slightly over the last 18 months (from 87 5% in May 2016) The same principle is true for other key cash cows of Microsoft such as its Office products As stated in Microsoft's annual report other players have established successful ecosystems as well primarily Apple (AAPL) which is integrating hardware and software/services sales in a great way but the two are active in different markets (Apple being more focused on consumers and Microsoft being more focused on B2B / enterprises with its offerings) and the market surely is big enough for multiple companies to earn a lot of money AAPL Microsoft's growth vectors are newer concepts such as Azure but it is quite foreseeable that its cash cows Windows and Office will continue to dominate their spaces for years thus providing a lot of visibility to earnings as well as cash flows going forward On top of that Microsoft has a world class balance sheet source Microsoft's most recent 10-Q source Microsoft's most recent 10-Q 10-Q Microsoft's balance sheet contains $138 billion of cash and equivalents which is substantially more than the $77 billion of long term debt that the company owes Microsoft not only has a $61 billion net cash position the company's assets are also mostly of a tangible nature Of the $249 billion in assets just 18% are in the form of goodwill and other intangibles This very strong balance sheet which is coupled with high and foreseeable cash flows is rewarded by a AAA rating by all relevant rating agencies making Microsoft just one of two publicly traded company to get that distinction (Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) being the other one) JNJ Relative to other stocks Microsoft thus looks like a very low-risk investment which is why I believe it is a viable choice for those seeking stable backbones for their portfolios and the returns Microsoft will deliver going forward will be solid too If Microsoft manages to grow its EPS by close to 12% annually going forward (as analysts are expecting) then high single-digit annual returns are possible even if the multiple shrinks going forward (which is not unlikely as shares are trading for more than 28 times trailing earnings) $2 96 in ttm earnings per share could turn to $5 20 in 2022 -- when we put a moderate 22 times earnings multiple on that estimate we get to a share price of $114 which would mean an annual share price increase of 6 3% over the next five years When we add in a dividend yielding two percent we get to high single-digit annual returns without the need for high multiples or multiple expansion and that return comes from a low-risk investment Takeaway Microsoft's shares would have to rally by well above sixty percent for the company's market cap to hit $1 trillion I thus believe that Evercore ISI's estimates are too aggressive Nevertheless Microsoft's shares have the potential to provide solid high single-digit annual returns going forward which is a quite attractive return from a low-risk investment such as Microsoft Disclosure I am/we are long JNJ Disclosure I am/we are long JNJ I wrote this article myself

Universe Dec 11 17 | About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Arya Nakhjavani Long/short equity commodities hedge fund analyst event-driven (262 followers) Summary The release of the Harmon Kardon Invoke and the Microsoft-Qualcomm deal has some implications about Microsoft's master plan With Windows 10's ability to work across platforms it makes it the clear choice for a "universal" AI assistant Microsoft really is not far behind Amazon Apple or Google and might soon pass them Firstly to my readers I am back after a rather long hiatus Due to the nature of my work I had a trading restriction as well as a conflict of interest which prevented me from publishing any articles or opinions on investment ideas Fortunately this restriction has since expired and I am again legally able to resume writing For those wondering this is not a fancy way of saying I was fired I turned down the return offer to pursue other opportunities But that is enough about myself let’s kick right back into gear This article will be more qualitative than quantitative The last one I wrote about developing a model for a geo-political risk-augmented capital asset pricing model was pure quantitative so I thought this would be a nice change of pace With the recent unveiling of Apple’s HomePod and Google’s Home Mini the final giant left out of the game is Microsoft (NASDAQ MSFT) … sort of Interestingly enough Microsoft falls into a much similar boat as Apple than Amazon who had to develop the entire smarthub ecosystem on its own Apple with Siri and Microsoft with Cortana both have the advantage of having users already on their platforms With Cortana and Siri both fully integrated in each company’s line of products the user base and cross-device synergies and communications already exists So why hasn’t the final giant jumped on board yet? Well the answer is they have… Again sort of Several months ago Harman Kardon finally unveiled its Cortana-powered speaker called Invoke The speaker has hit the stores in Fall 2017 though it does not appear to have gain the same traction as its competitor's similar product lines Now this action is an atom bomb of implications for all the giants but especially for Microsoft About this article Expand page 1 / 7 | Next » Recommended for you 8 5 Billion Reasons To Buy Apple Stock Andres Cardenal CFA • Dec 12 2017 4 00 AM ET If You Don't Own Any Bitcoin Read This Chris Martenson • Dec 13 2017 3 48 AM ET Nvidia And AMD Only One Month Later The Fortune Teller • Dec 12 2017 7 27 PM ET Microsoft Poised To Take Over The (Smart) Universe Dec 11 17 | About Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Arya Nakhjavani Long/short equity commodities hedge fund analyst event-driven (262 followers) Summary The release of the Harmon Kardon Invoke and the Microsoft-Qualcomm deal has some implications about Microsoft's master plan With Windows 10's ability to work across platforms it makes it the clear choice for a "universal" AI assistant Microsoft really is not far behind Amazon Apple or Google and might soon pass them Firstly to my readers I am back after a rather long hiatus Due to the nature of my work I had a trading restriction as well as a conflict of interest which prevented me from publishing any articles or opinions on investment ideas Fortunately this restriction has since expired and I am again legally able to resume writing For those wondering this is not a fancy way of saying I was fired I turned down the return offer to pursue other opportunities But that is enough about myself let’s kick right back into gear This article will be more qualitative than quantitative The last one I wrote about developing a model for a geo-political risk-augmented capital asset pricing model was pure quantitative so I thought this would be a nice change of pace With the recent unveiling of Apple’s HomePod and Google’s Home Mini the final giant left out of the game is Microsoft (NASDAQ MSFT) … sort of Interestingly enough Microsoft falls into a much similar boat as Apple than Amazon who had to develop the entire smarthub ecosystem on its own Apple with Siri and Microsoft with Cortana both have the advantage of having users already on their platforms With Cortana and Siri both fully integrated in each company’s line of products the user base and cross-device synergies and communications already exists So why hasn’t the final giant jumped on board yet?

Well the answer is they have… Again sort of MSFT Several months ago Harman Kardon finally unveiled its Cortana-powered speaker called Invoke The speaker has hit the stores in Fall 2017 though it does not appear to have gain the same traction as its competitor's similar product lines Now this action is an atom bomb of implications for all the giants but especially for Microsoft The obvious implication first Microsoft has thrown its hat in the ring of giants competing for the lion’s share of the smart-home/smart device market… Sort of I say “sort of” because Harman Kardon’s Invoke is almost a direct copy of Amazon’s Echo Though most of the smart speakers from the giants share similar characteristics the Invoke has almost none It is just a slightly more curvy Amazon Echo Secondly it is an outsourced device Though to be sold in Microsoft stores the product won't have the product or brand recognition if it was a Microsoft product Now there are indeed reasons for this First and for mostly Microsoft has always been primarily software company With more recent pushes into creating “platforms and productivity services” according to the company’s 2017 10-K It’s device offerings range from its flagship gaming console Xbox to tablet and laptops All of which are Cortana enabled Currently with over 141 million active monthly users the question is whether or not Microsoft will make the plunge into the smart speaker/ smart hub market Secondly its outsourcing of the first cortana-enabled speaker might be to test the waters without taking on any risk This would seem like the smart choice at the cost of some potential future self-cannibalization From a consumer perspective it seems like the smart choice Though Amazon has had the first mover advantage along with extremely competitive pricing the ecosystem of Amazon devices does not reach as far as Apple Google or Microsoft Even with the nearly countless number of apps on all three platforms the first to reach the end goal wins the game So what is this end goal? Is the victor judged by which device is the cheapest or the most wide spread? Currently the consumer and the market think so But a look ahead to the future of the smart home shows something entirely different The victor will be the one who encapsulates the entire smart home universe A universal artificial assistant which crosses over through all aspects of a consumer’s daily life Our winner would need to be present on the go in my home and in my car So which platform will reach this first? Well I am not sure I have the answer to that But I could take some educated guesses Let’s first look at Amazon’s Alexa AI With the largest integrations so far Alexa is probably the most comprehensive Smart home platform on the market With full integration across a vast number of devices and smart hub systems But there are also a few key ones that Alexa is missing currently a mobile and a PC platform In addition to this it's FireTV and Fire Tablets do have Alexa but these almost seem forced and it has done nothing innovative with it Amazon’s failed attempt to enter the smartphone market has indeed set the company back on its quest to maintain its dominance as the leader in the smarthome world The company has started to utilize its advanced AI in the Amazon shopping app but its reach and conveniences still does not reach as far as Apple’s Google’s or Microsoft’s Because when it comes to either of those three each boasts a full line of AI assistant enabled computers smartphones and tablet Amazon lineup has expanded consistently with six smart home/ smart speaker devices (I am not counting the Amazon Tap here as it is more of a bluetooth speaker that so happens to have some limited Alexa capabilities) What is interesting is that Amazon has kept its first-mover advantage and entered some competition with Apple’s Facetime app with its own Echo Spot and Echo Show devices The adoption of these devices remains to be seen But it is clear that Apple hold an advantage with its Facetime over Amazon as its Facetime app is build into the operating system on all of its smartphones laptops desktops and tablets This is something that Microsoft may have taken the loss on it seems Without the widespread use of its failed smartphone you would think that is would be the end of Microsoft’s dream but I would argue that it was just the start of its new path to success But I will get into that more later On to Google Google’s lineup is interesting It falls somewhere in the middle of Apple and Amazon It boasts a line up of smart speaker devices that directly compete with Amazon’s Echo Plus and Echo Dot while also offering laptops and smartphones of its own The interesting thing is that Apple Google and Microsoft all offer competing lines of operating systems Again the real interesting thing is that Apple has two separate systems iOS for mobile and MacOS for its desktop and laptop product lines These two separate operating systems are able to communicate to some degree but are not uniform Google’s operating system known as Chrome OS is strange to say the least If you watch any video reviewing the Google Pixelbook or any of the other Chromebooks you will hear the same thing No one can fully recommend it unless your requirements are very limited Anything other than basically just browsing checking emails and basic word editing and the device isn't the ideal solution In my opinion the Chromebook is a half measure solution which isn't viable in the long-term Its two smart speakers the Google Home and Google Home Mini are indeed direct competitors to Amazon’s smart speaker lineup They are priced to match in fact Though they offer slightly less features (due to being on the market for shorter times) they do offer something that Amazon’s currently do not In some sense when using both you will notice that the Google Home products respond more natively to requests than Amazon’s Alexa Now this isn’t a deal breaker just something to be aware of Moving on to Apple which has just recently announced its HomePod its answer to the smart speaker Though priced significantly higher than the Google Amazon or even Microsoft versions it will no-doubt bring the tech giant back into the ring Of all the giants Apple definitely has the best opportunity to be the final winner Its products line of desktops and especially laptops smart phones and tablets definitely set it far ahead of the competition And as almost everyone in the world knows Apple’s full lineup I will skip over the breakdown and move into the meat of this article I have summarized the bulk of this info in the table below As you can see from the oh-so-simple chart above which almost summarizes the entire section before it Apple and Google are (technically speaking) tied for the lead Now if we discount the fact that Google’s laptop line isn’t nearly in the same ballpark as Microsoft or Apple then we see that Microsoft and Google are tied for second place Now I know Microsoft also technically has a smartphone… but it is nothing revolutionary and I did not count it just like I did not count the Fire Phone Microsoft’s phone was largely a flop and does not represent a flagship phone like we are seeing today With this competition to capture the smarthome market Microsoft’s focus on enterprise business and customers may grant it access to another market Once Windows 10 is integrated fully into the corporate world the integration of Cortana will open the AI assistant to learn many new skills aimed at improving productivity But this isn’t the full story As of right now I believe that Microsoft is poised to change everything and taking a bet on the tech giant would be smart Though it didn’t come has huge news Microsoft’s Windows 10 did something unbelievable it created a uniform operating system for all devices The brand new Surfacebook 2 is a perfect example of this In laptop mode windows 10 functions like normal But if you remove the screen the computer transitions into Tablet mode What does this mean exactly? It means that windows could run Windows 10 on every tablet and every phone and it would have the same level of customization and power as the full desktop version This is a huge advancement which I believe Microsoft has done in preparation of its next steps To further this idea I point to the announcement several days ago Microsoft and Qualcomm announced that Windows would power some of its systems with Qualcomm's mobile Snapdragon chipset Think flagship mobile performance but with Windows 10 and battery power and best parts of a laptop This final "test" stage union shows exactly where Microsoft is heading The real announcement comes with the fact that these new generation of computers are LTE enabled This would essentially end one of the major downsides to using a laptop versus a mobile platform announcement Microsoft looks like it might be ready to upset Apple on the set of innovation Multiple Apple Fanboy youtube channels have already made videos with millions of views discussing how disappointed they are with Apple’s new generation of product lines (non mobile) and how amazing the new line of Microsoft Surface devices are This would give way to thinking that maybe Apple has lost that cutting edge innovative touch that it had in years past The industry leader has now taken to follow the lead of its competitors in many aspects it seems while Microsoft continues guns blazing full steam ahead Obviously before I rattle to many cages without backing it up with numbers I will assure readers that more articles above Microsoft and how it stacks up against competitors will be coming soon Now the question becomes this how fast can Microsoft expand Cortana throughout its devices? How fast can they make Cortana on the Xbox actually so useful that it becomes a chromecast style navigation instrument? How fast can they partner with hardware manufacturers or do it themselves and release a flagship windows 10 phone product line? Those are the questions that need to be asked if Microsoft wants to dominate its competition In my mind they have set up all the dominos they need to Now they just need to knock the first one down Disclosure I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT over the next 72 hours Disclosure I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT over the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Additional disclosure I am not a registered investment advisor or broker/dealer Readers should conduct their own research and due diligence and obtain professional advice before making investment decision I will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by information obtained herein Readers are solely responsible for their own investment decisions Additional disclosure About this article Expand About this article Expand Author payment $35 + $0 01/page view Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500 Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Application SoftwareWant to share your opinion on this article?

FINANCEGLOBALMARKETSEARNINGS Finance Analyzing the Insider Data for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) ROBYN RYAN 2 days ago Recent insider trends for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) have caught the attention of investors Patters in insider activity can help analysts formulate an outlook for a stock In the case of MSFT the data has a lot to say about how the stock might perform going forward Institutions own 75 02% of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)’s shares The total value of these holdings in millions is $487 070 Among active positions in the latest quarter 1 048 holders increased their positions by a total of 175 49 million shares 1 265 holders decreased the positions by a total of 173 55 million shares and 234 holders held their positions This works out to a net increase in ownership of 1 94 million shares and suggests that institutions are feeling bullish about the stock Among new and sold out positions 86 holders initiated new positions by a total of 22 39 million shares and 52 holders exited their positions by a total of 2 12 million shares This nets out to an increase of 20 26 million shares and is a bullish sign for MSFT In the last three months insiders executed a total of 27 trades 14 of these were buys and 13 were sells Insider ownership increased by a total of 272665 shares which suggests that MSFT’s key executives are feeling more optimistic about the outlook for the stock The data from the past twelve months tells a different story insiders executed 31 buys and 81 sells and ownership decreased by a net of 45 84 million shares Short interest or the number of a stock’s tradable shares currently being shorted is another metric investors use to get a pulse on sentiment Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT)’s short interest is 50 55 million shares or 0 67% of the float This represents a decrease of -5% in the number of shares being shorted compared to the previous reading and implies that investors felt less pessimistic about the stock during the past two weeks Ownership trends and trading patterns can be useful tools for predicting a stock’s performance but it’s also important to consider the technicals in order to form a more comprehensive view A composite of 13 technical indicators that includes measures such as moving averages and momentum oscillators suggests that MSFT is a buy which implies that MSFT is expected to outperform the market based on prior trading patterns Conclusion Institutional ownership trends suggest that the stock is cheap and the insider trading data indicates that insiders are bullish

recent stories Microsoft releases Quantum Development Kit – play with qubits teleportation and entanglement now KAREEM ANDERSON EMAIL @MINDHEAD1 1 DAY AGO IN LATEST NEWS The second half of 2017 has seen a Microsoft driven by the thought concept and eventual actuality of a future teeming with quantum computing Event after event and keynote pursuant keynote executives from Microsoft have championed the phrase quantum computing perhaps to the dismay of their layman fans and developers who haven’t quite wrapped their heads around the study of computation systems Fortunately Microsoft is looking to help usher in its new age of quantum computing and help people get on board with a new free preview of its Quantum Developer Kit Microsoft is releasing a free preview version of its Quantum Development Kit which includes the Q# programming language a quantum computing simulator and other resources for people who want to start writing applications for a quantum computer The Q# programming language was built from the ground up specifically for quantum computing The Quantum Development Kit which Microsoft first announced at its Ignite conference in September is designed for developers who are eager to learn how to program on quantum computers whether or not they are experts in the field of quantum physics Microsoft is attempting to lower the barrier to entry and make Quantum Computing as accessible as possible for interested developers by tieing the preview to Visual Studio through some deep integration that then reaches back out to quantum simulators The power to stimulate around 30 logical qubits of quantum computing power can be wielded by developers using an average laptop thanks to some tweaks on Microsoft’s end As with most things Microsoft is doing these days it’s offering up an Azure-based simulation for anything larger than the 30 logical qubits of quantum processing the additional cloud-horse power can begin simulations larger than 40 qubits of computation Microsoft will also be providing some documentation to help walk people through some Quantum computing theories and concepts including the idea of quantum teleportation for fans looking to bring Sam Beckett back home (insert favorite Quantum Leap episode) The hope with this new preview is to get developers fiddling with the new technology to hopefully pave the way for solutions that can provide a future filled with realistic applications and algorithms to address artificial intelligence climate change and cryptography “What you’re going to see as a developer is the opportunity to tie into tools that you already know well services you already know well There will be a twist with quantum computing but it’s our job to make it as easy as possible for the developers who know and love us to be able to use these new tools that could potentially do some things exponentially faster – which means going from a billion years on a classical computer to a couple hours on a quantum computer

SERVICES TECHNOLOGY STOCKS BUZZ Home Technology Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) – Tracking the Technical Picture Technology Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) – Tracking the Technical Picture By Miguel Arevalo -11th December 2017018 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Technical analysis of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock Technical analysis of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock includes the study of technical indicators and past trends For technical analysis of stock and trends here we employ the use of tools such as trading volumes Simple Moving averages RSI (14) and ATR (14) to determine the future behavior of a stock Much of this practice involves discovering the overall trend line of a stock’s movement Technical analysis of stocks and trends has been used by serious traders for decades Although it does not guarantee success and is not 100% accurate it is still one of the two key methods of analyzing stock prices along with fundamental analysis Volume and Price On Dec 08 Shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) were valued at $84 16 and moved 2 02% as of a recent closing trade A total volume of 24 03 million shares were traded versus to average volume of 20 54 million shares If you are going to be trading the stock you want to ensure volume is healthy so you are not stuck in a position Volumes indicate how many shares are bought and sold over a given period of time The more active the share higher would be its volume Technical analysts believe that volume can serve as a warning signal as to whether a stock is on the verge of breaking into upside territory (high volume) or into a downside trend (low volume) Low volume of a security even if it’s rising in price can indicate a lack of conviction among investors Conversely high volume of a particular security can indicate that traders are placing their long-term confidence in the investment Volume is incredibly important to traders Without volume it becomes more difficult to buy or sell securities when you want to and at the price you want Simple Moving averages Chart patterns can be difficult to read given the volatility in price movements of MSFT Moving averages can help smooth out these erratic movements by removing day-to-day fluctuations and make trends easier to spot Since they take the average of past price movements moving averages are better for accurately reading past price movements rather than predicting future past movements We have taken technical analysis of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)’s stock recent trading price and 3 moving average price of updated past trading days (20 50 and 200) It shows a stock price recent trends and movement that can help investor and traders in trading Moving average is popular technical tool and can be customized to any time frame suiting both long term investors and short-term traders In terms of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock price comparison to its moving averages shares of company are 4 33% away from the 50-day moving average and 1 06% away from 20-day average If we take a long term observation shares have been trading at a distance of 16 12% from the 200-day moving average Moving averages are used as a strong indicator for technical stock analysis and it helps investors in figuring out where the stock has been and also facilitate in determining where it may be possibly heading There can be no complete understanding of moving averages without an understanding of trends A trend is simply a price that is continuing to move in a certain direction There are only three real trends that a security can follow (1) An uptrend or bullish trend means that the price is moving higher (2) A downtrend or bearish trend means the price is moving lower (3) A sideways trend where the price is moving sideways The important thing to remember about trends is that prices rarely move in a straight line Therefore moving-average lines are used to help a trader more easily identify the direction of the trend 52 week High and Low Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) shares have been seen trading -2 37% off its 52 week- peak value and changed 38 33% from its 52 week-bottom price value The “percentage off the 52-week high or low” refers to when a stock current price is relative to where it has traded over the last 52 weeks This gives investors an idea of how much the security has moved in the last year and whether it is trading near the top middle or bottom of the range Relative Strength Index (RSI) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 58 16 RSI is a technical indicator of price momentum comparing the size of recent gains to the size of recent losses and establishes oversold and overbought positions Technical analysts have little regard for the value of a company They use historic price data to observe stock price patterns to predict the direction of that price going forward Analysts use common formulas and ratios to accomplish this The Relative Strength Index (RSI) developed by J Welles Wilder is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 A value between 0 and 30 is considered oversold hence the trader should look at buying opportunities A value between 70 and 100 is considered overbought hence the trader should look at selling opportunities Performance Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) held 7 74 billion outstanding shares currently The company have shares float of 7 61 billion Now have a look at past performance (weekly performance to year to date performance) how Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has been moved whether it performed well or not MSFT reported a change of -0 12% over the last week and performed -0 47% over the last month while its year to date (YTD) performance revealed an activity trend of 35 44% The stock’s quarterly performance specifies a shift of 12 57% and its last twelve month performance is stands at 37 94% while moved 20 61% for the past six months Volatility Average True Range (14) for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is stands at 1 33 ATR is a volatility indicator Volatility measures the strength of the price action and is often overlooked for clues on market direction The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data Simply a stock experiencing a high level of volatility has a higher ATR and a low volatility stock has a lower ATR The ATR may be used by market technicians to enter and exit trades and it is a useful tool to add to a trading system It was created to allow traders to more accurately measure the daily volatility of an asset by using simple calculations The indicator does not indicate the price direction rather it is used primarily to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves Typically the Average True Range (ATR) is based on 14 periods Over the past week the company showed volatility of 2 26% Moving out to look at the previous month volatility move the stock is at 1 42% A stock with a price that fluctuates wildly hits new highs and lows or moves erratically is considered highly volatile A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility A highly volatile stock is inherently riskier but that risk cuts both ways When investing in a volatile security the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure For this reason many traders with a high risk tolerance look to multiple measures of volatility to help inform their trade strategies When selecting a security for investment traders look at its historical volatility to help determine the relative risk of a potential trade There are numerous metrics that measure volatility in differing contexts and each trader has favorites Regardless of which metric you utilize a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing Simply put volatility is a reflection of the degree to which price moves Beta measures volatility or systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole 1 shows stock moves with market < 1 means less volatile than market > 1 indicates more volatile than the market The stock’s beta is 1 00 Analyst mean recommendation rating on a stock by the analyst community is at 1 80 Analyst rating score as published on FINVIZ are rated on a 1 to 5 scale 1 is equivalent to a buy rating 3 a

indicate a lack of conviction among investors Conversely high volume of a particular security can indicate that traders are placing their long-term confidence in the investment Volume is incredibly

facilitate in determining where it may be possibly heading There can be no complete understanding of moving averages without an understanding of trends A trend is simply a price that is continuing to move in a certain direction There are only three real trends that a security can follow (1) An uptrend or bullish trend means that the price is moving higher (2) A downtrend or bearish trend means the price is moving lower (3) A sideways trend where the price is moving sideways The important thing to remember about trends is that prices rarely move in a straight line Therefore moving-average lines are used to help a trader more easily identify the direction of the trend 52 week High and Low Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) shares have been seen trading -2 37% off its 52 week- peak value and changed 38 33% from its 52 week-bottom price value The “percentage off the 52-week high or low” refers to when a stock current price is relative to where it has traded over the last 52 weeks This gives

Volatility measures the strength of the price action and is often overlooked for clues on market direction The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data Simply a stock experiencing a high level of volatility has a higher ATR and a low volatility stock has a lower ATR The ATR may be used by market technicians to enter and exit trades and it is a useful tool to add to a trading system It was created to allow traders to more accurately measure the daily volatility of an asset by using simple calculations The indicator does not indicate the price direction rather it is used primarily to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves Typically the Average True Range (ATR) is based on 14 periods Over the past week the company showed volatility of 2 26% Moving out to look at the previous month volatility move the stock is at 1 42% A stock with a price that fluctuates wildly hits new highs and lows or moves erratically is considered highly volatile A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility A highly volatile stock is inherently riskier but that risk cuts both ways When investing in a volatile security the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure For this reason many traders with a high risk tolerance look to multiple measures of volatility to help inform their trade strategies When

(Beta & Volatility Analysis) Risk management is a fundamental process used to make investment decisions The process involves spotting the amount of risk involved and either accepting or mitigating the risk linked with an investment Some common measures of risk are standard deviation beta value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk Standard deviation gauges the dispersion of data from its projected value The standard deviation is used in making an investment decision to measure the amount of historical volatility or risk linked with an investment relative to its annual rate of return It represents how much the current return is deviating from its predictable historical normal returns For example a stock that has a high standard deviation experiences higher volatility and therefore a higher level of risk is associated with the stock After a recent check Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT)’s last month price volatility comes out to be 1 42% which for the week stands at 2 26% Volatility is one of those things which for many retail shareholders means very little but it’s the basis on which stocks and are traded and the sentiment in markets is also assessed High volatility can make entering or an exit a stock expensive it can also exacerbate price increases and potential profits to the upside and downside Another common measure of risk is Beta Beta measures the amount of systematic risk a security has relative to the whole market The market has a beta of 1 and it can be used to gauge the risk of a security The beta value of MSFT stands at 1 00 If a security’s beta is equal to 1 the security’s price moves in time step with the market A security with a beta greater than 1 indicates that it is more volatile than the market Conversely if a security’s beta is less than 1 it indicates that the security is less volatile than the market For example suppose a security’s beta is 1 5 In theory the security is 50% more volatile than the market In-Depth Volatility Analysis Developed by J Welles Wilder the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that gauges volatility As with most of his indicators Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind Commodities are normally more volatile than stocks They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session A volatility formula based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves Wilder created Average True Range to capture this “missing” volatility It is important to remember that ATR does not provide an indication of price direction just volatility ATR is counted for different periods like 9-day 14-day 20-day 50-day and 100-day At the moment the 14-days ATR for

an examination of past price movements Technical indicators collectively called “technicals” are distinguished by the fact that they do not analyze any part of the fundamental business like earnings

(Beta & Volatility Analysis) Risk management is a fundamental process used to make investment decisions The process involves spotting the amount of risk involved and either accepting or mitigating the risk linked with an investment Some common measures of risk are standard deviation beta value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk Standard deviation gauges the dispersion of data from its projected value The standard deviation is used in making an investment decision to measure the amount of historical volatility or risk linked with an investment relative to its annual rate of return It represents how much the current return is deviating from its predictable historical normal returns For example a stock that has a high standard deviation experiences higher volatility and therefore a higher level of risk is associated with the stock After a recent check Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT)’s last month price volatility comes out to be 1 42% which for the week stands at 2 26% Volatility is one of those things which for many retail shareholders means very little but it’s the basis on which stocks and are traded and the sentiment in markets is also assessed High volatility can make entering or an exit a stock expensive it can also exacerbate price increases and potential profits to the upside and downside Another common measure of risk is Beta Beta measures the amount of systematic risk a security has relative to the whole market The market has a beta of 1 and it can be used to gauge the risk of a security The beta value of MSFT stands at 1 00 If a security’s beta is equal to 1 the security’s price moves in time step with the market A security with a beta greater than 1 indicates that it is more volatile than the market Conversely if a security’s beta is less than 1 it indicates that the security is less volatile than the market For example suppose a security’s beta is 1 5 In theory the security is 50% more volatile than the market In-Depth Volatility

Commodities are normally more volatile than stocks They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session A volatility formula based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves Wilder created Average True Range to capture this “missing” volatility It is important to remember that ATR does not provide an indication of price direction just volatility ATR is counted for different periods like 9-day 14-day 20-day 50-day and 100-day At the moment the 14-days ATR for
