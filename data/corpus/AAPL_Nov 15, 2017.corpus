Investment Research Per a research report by Canalys Apple Inc AAPL was the market leader in the wearables bands space in the third quarter of 2017 benefiting from the launch of Watch Series 3 research report Apple Inc AAPL Canalys analyst Jason Low stated that "strong demand for the LTE-enabled Apple Watch Series 3 has dispelled service providers' doubts about the cellular smartwatch not appealing to customers " He also added that Apple Watch 3 hasn't reached its "full potential" as service providers underestimated its demand In the third quarter of 2017 Apple took the lead with shipments of 3 9 million units including 800 000 LTE editions Apple called Watch series 3 as the "ultimate expression of Apple Watch" at its key note address at the September event Integrated with a built-in cellular and Apple Music the Watch is powered by a new dual core processor which is 70% faster than its predecessor Users can now call text as well as access GPS and third-party applications like WeChat with the Watch Apple had touted the built-in cellular as the USP of the Watch However initially the Watch had troubles connecting to LTE A bug caused the watch to join unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks thus preventing it from connecting to cellular networks In October Apple released the watch OS 4 0 1 update to Apple Watch Series 3 which fixes the bug We note that Apple doesn't provide any data on Watch sales On its last earnings conference call the company said that Watch sales were up 50% for the third successive quarter while the entire wearables business was up 75% year
