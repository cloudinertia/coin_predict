rally another 4% to 5% before December options expire Facebook Inc (FB) FB stock is once again on the hot list after the shares broke out above near-term resistance at the $180 level FB broke above $180 on Oct 31 following Facebook’s quarterly earnings report but the shares were unable to hold ground As a result FB stock had been locked beneath resistance in the region ever since The shares’ breakout would have more significance if it didn’t occur during a light trading week however so traders should proceed with caution Options traders meanwhile are planning to ride this rally out Volume on Tuesday jumped to 241 000 contracts with calls snapping up 64% of the day’s take This level of optimism stands in contrast to the uncertainty in FB’s December series Specifically the December put/call OI ratio has risen in recent weeks to arrive at 0 80 with calls and puts just shy of parity This reading is also in the upper 10% of all those taken in the past year for FB stock which typically sees a monthly put/call OI ratio in the lower 0 60 range In short investors remain largely wary of FB stock over the short term Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) (VOD) VOD calls were flying off the shelves like Black Friday doorbusters on Tuesday Practically 100% of all VOD options activity was comprised of call contracts (the table above rounds up) yesterday while volume itself rocketed to more than 42 times the stock’s daily average Regular readers of this column (and VOD stockholders) know that this activity typically indicates one thing an ex-dividend date Yesterday was the last day to own/control VOD stock if you wanted to collect the Vodafone’s 56 cent-per-share dividend payout on next month One of the ways options traders do this without actually buying the stock is to purchase in-the-money call options As of this writing Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities If you’re still trading today you’re among the minority Volume has thinned

AAPL yesterday Expectations in the AAPL options pits remains considerably elevated despite the stock’s lofty heights The December put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0 53 with puts practically doubling calls among front-month options What’s more peak call OI for the series totals 51 000 contracts at the overhead $180 strike indicating that options traders are looking for AAPL to rally another 4% to 5% before December options expire Facebook Inc (FB) FB stock is once again on the hot list after the shares broke out above near-term resistance at the $180 level FB broke above $180 on Oct 31 following Facebook’s quarterly earnings report but the shares were unable to hold ground As a result FB stock had been locked beneath resistance in the region ever since The shares’ breakout would have more significance if it didn’t occur during a light trading week however so traders should proceed with caution Options traders meanwhile are planning to ride this rally out Volume on Tuesday jumped to 241 000 contracts with calls snapping up 64% of the day’s take This level of optimism stands in contrast to the uncertainty in FB’s December series Specifically the December put/call OI ratio has risen in recent weeks to arrive at 0 80 with calls and puts just shy of parity This reading is also in the upper 10% of all those taken in the past year for FB stock which typically sees a monthly put/call OI ratio in the lower 0 60 range In short investors remain largely wary of FB stock over the short term Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) (VOD) VOD calls were flying off the

than 42 times the stock’s daily average Regular readers of this column (and VOD stockholders) know that this activity typically indicates one thing an ex-dividend date Yesterday was the last day to own/control VOD stock if you wanted to collect the Vodafone’s 56 cent-per-share dividend payout on next month One of the ways options traders do this without actually buying the stock is to purchase in-the-money call options As of this writing Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities If you’re still trading today you’re among the minority Volume has thinned
