out of USA When looking at Apple Inc it is crucial to find out the sector and industry it belongs too which is respectively Consumer Goods and Electronic Equipment It helps to provide a relevant benchmark to how the company is performing against others in the industry Alternatively you can use the Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E) to compare against others and to gauge growth potential However P/E only paints a small picture of what else could be used to compare against its main competitors Because 18 8 is isolated for the performance of the stock alone the 14 26 factors in growth to get a better outlook on its future performance since P/E can present a high-growth stock as overvalued An increase in the PEG over time shows signs of continued consistent growth Apple Inc current annual EPS growth is at 10 80% thus confirming the 14 26 ratio The current dividend yield for Apple Inc is 1 46% The dividend yield expresses to the investor the amount of return to expect against the amount of capital invested in the stock That is why the dividend yield is directly affected by the current share price If the yield were to stay constant but the stock price to decrease then you would see an increase in the dividend yield Dividends are paid out to investors from the free cash flow that the company has Currently Apple Inc has a free cash flow of 17 61 showing that they can continue to pay dividends without any problems It always pays to check deeper than the surface of the usual business metrics An investor should look at the management end of the company and how their decisions have reflected through the company stock Check to see if the CEO’s and other directors officers have a stake in the business which can show confidence inside management Same goes with institutional

be made solely based on its fundamentals One must always look at what the charts may provide If not an investor can expect disastrous consequences such as buying in an under or overextended market or at and that’s just one example There are tons of technical indicators out there but we will focus on some primary ones The Apple Inc ’s 50 and 200 period moving averages are and which can gauge the strength or weakness of a trend against long and short-term outlooks The Apple Inc ’s average volume is 28 817 47 This technical indicator is important to understand the type of liquidity the stock holds The more volume the easier it will be to exit a position and vice versa Moreover when the average volume increases or decreases can provide sentiment to the volatility of the stock Right now Apple Inc ’s volatility for the month is 1 45% Lastly more shares traded means less of a spread in between the bid and the ask which can effect your bottom line An investor can also look at the weekly volatility to gain greater confirmation to their outlook Finishing Up Although you have the information necessary from the fundamental and technical side of the stock it is best to check for any impending catalysts such as earnings guidance or any other economic event that can cause the stock to deviate from its current position More so be sure to check the company’s debts and whether they can afford the monthly interest payments Apple Inc ’s debt-to-equity ratio is and its interest coverage is which will tell you if the company is financially sound enough Having high debt doesn’t automatically mark a company as poor A company can have significant amounts of debt but the return on investments must make it applicable Take the current research of Apple Inc and include your

(Market Capitalization Analysis) Now investors want to know the actual market worth of the company in the Stock Market Market worth or Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares As a company has 5 15B shares outstanding and its current share price is $172 02 the market cap is $889 15B From a safety point of view a company’s size and market value do matter All things being equal large cap stocks are considered safer than small cap stocks However small cap stocks have greater potential for growth Although market capitalization is key to consider don’t invest (or not invest) based solely on it It’s just one measure of value As a serious shareholder you need to look at plentiful factors that can assist you determine whether any given stock is a good investment Is The Stock A Good Investment? (P/E Analysis) Price-earnings ratio also known as P/E ratio is a tool that is used by shareholders to help decide whether they should buy a stock Basically the P/E ratio tells potential shareholders how much they have to pay for every $1 of earnings The formula for calculating the price-earnings ratio for any stock is simple the market value per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS) This is represented as the equation (P/EPS) where P is the market price and EPS is the earnings per share As the current market price of the stock is $172 02 and diluted EPS for the trailing twelve month is 9 19 the P/E ratio for the stock comes out as 18 80 Generally shareholders love stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio The perception is that the lower the P/E the higher will be the value of the stock The simple logic that a stock’s current market price does not justify (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind shareholders’ inclination toward low P/E stocks Price/Earnings to Growth – PEG Ratio Analysis The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period For now the company has PEG ratio of 1 76 The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock’s value while taking the company’s earnings growth into account and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio Despite the fact that a low P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy factoring in the company’s growth rate to get the stock’s PEG ratio can tell a different story The lower the PEG ratio the more the stock may be undervalued given its earnings performance The degree to which a PEG ratio value indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type though a broad rule of thumb is that a PEG ratio below one is desirable Also the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used Using historical growth rates for example may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are predictable to deviate from historical growth rates To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical

(P/E Analysis) Is The Stock A Good Investment? (P/E Analysis) Price-earnings ratio also known as P/E ratio is a tool that is used by shareholders to help decide whether they should buy a stock Basically the P/E ratio tells potential shareholders how much they have to pay for every $1 of earnings The formula for calculating the price-earnings ratio for any stock is simple the market value per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS) This is represented as the equation (P/EPS) where P is the market price and EPS is the earnings per share As the current market price of the stock is $172 02 and diluted EPS for the trailing twelve month is 9 19 the P/E ratio for the stock comes out as 18 80 Generally shareholders love stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio The perception is that the lower the P/E the higher will be the value of the stock The simple logic that a stock’s current market price does not justify (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind shareholders’ inclination toward low P/E stocks Price/Earnings to Growth – PEG Ratio Analysis Price/Earnings to Growth – PEG Ratio Analysis The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period For now the company has PEG ratio of 1 76 The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock’s value while taking the company’s earnings growth into account and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio Despite the fact that a low P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy factoring in the company’s growth rate to get the stock’s PEG ratio can tell a different story The lower the PEG ratio the more the stock may be undervalued given its earnings performance The degree to which a PEG ratio value indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type though a broad rule of thumb is that a PEG ratio below one is desirable Also the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used Using historical growth rates for example may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are predictable to deviate from historical growth rates To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth the terms “forward PEG” and “trailing PEG” are sometimes used Stock’s Liquidity Analysis Stock’s Liquidity Analysis Presently 0 08% shares

grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 1 95% in the last trading session to close at $172 67 The Apple Watch does a fine job of tracking your exercise if you’re running or walking around But it sometimes has trouble giving accurate readings if you work out at a gym – for instance it might not understand that you’re climbing virtual stairs on a stair-stepper or understand the incline on a cross-trainer or treadmill Workout machines don’t give a particularly accurate view of your exercise on their own either Typically people get on an exercise machine without entering in their height weight gender and age – all details that are imperative to getting an accurate measurement of calories burned (Source CNBC) A total of 34 251 454 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 28 82M shares while its relative volume stands at 1 19 Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day and it’s displayed as a ratio If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks though currencies futures and options are traded as well) usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so therefore they trade on Stocks in Play In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday Most company stocks have very little volatility They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results which may only happen a couple of times a year at best In deciding what to focus on – in a stock say – a typical day trader looks for three things liquidity volatility and trading volume Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i e tight spreads or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock and low slippage or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price) If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day 100 000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1 000 000 Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly within a day of trading known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV) A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock Often a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump either up or down Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates More volatility means greater profit or loss After a recent check Apple Inc (NASDAQ AAPL) stock is found to be 1 75% volatile for the week while 1 45% volatility is recorded for the month Apple® declared
