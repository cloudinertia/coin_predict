Buffett has a simple prediction for the future of Apple (AAPL) Seth Archer Nov 30 2017 10 27 AM Getty Some cynics have been calling for the slow death of Apple since its legendary founder Steve Jobs died in 2011 But Warren Buffett recently endorsed the company and is heavily invested in its future Apple's economic moat or competitive advantage could be what saves the company and allows its profits to continue to grow Watch Apple's stock move in real time Since the death of legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs it's become somewhat fashionable to opine about the slow death of Apple The company angered customers by removing the iPhone's headphone jack alienated pro users by not including a standard set of ports on its newest laptops and has struggled to offer a competitive experience with its Siri voice assistant But UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said that looking to another legend Warren Buffett can provide a bit of insight on the future for Apple "Warren Buffett differentiates between franchises and businesses A franchise is based on offerings that are needed thought by customers to have no close substitute and not subject to price regulation " Milunovich wrote in a note to clients "Franchises enjoy such strong economics that they can survive mismanagement If that's true then concerns about Apple losing its mojo post-Jobs could be accurate yet misplaced though we think management is performing well " Buffett recently endorsed Apple by disclosing a 2 6% stake in the company making his Berkshire Hathaway the fifth-largest owner of Apple shares The move notably goes against his famous investing habit of staying away from tech The reason Buffett is so confident in Apple's ability to outperform its rivals comes down to his simple theory of economic moats A company with a wide competitive advantage has a "moat" around its business that can keep other players at an arm's length and give the company room to maneuver It can be argued that despite several recent hardware missteps Apple has maintained and expanded its economic moat Apple customers tend to spend like high-value customers when they step into an Apple store even when they wouldn't exhibit those behaviors at other retailers Milunovich explains Apple's customers are incredibly loyal and show their love by opening their wallets With its $1 000 iPhone X Apple is certainly testing the limits of that theory but even if the new phone hasn't sparked a "supercycle" like some analysts have predicted demand has been strong since launch And Apple is using its economic moat to jumpstart the next big revenue driver for the company which may not come from a new or updated hardware product "Apple says that the vast majority of iPhone users do not purchase its services but once they do that spending increases The company's challenge shifts from attracting users to the ecosystem to emptying their wallets once there " Milunovich said If Apple can start nudging its existing customers to start spending money on services like Apple Music iCloud storage upgrades or Apple Care plans the company can better monetize its loyal user base and pull even more money from them each month Because of its economic moat and loyal customers Milunovich shares Buffett's bullish outlook on Apple He rates the company a buy with a price target of $190 about 12 7% higher than the company's current price Apple is up 46 15% this year Read more about how Apple's mojo may be weakening Markets Insider SEE ALSO STOCKS HIT A RECORD HIGH Here's what you need to know » READ NOW India is buying world's emptiest

Getty Some cynics have been calling for the slow death of Apple since its legendary founder Steve Jobs died in 2011 But Warren Buffett recently endorsed the company and is heavily invested in its future Apple's economic moat or competitive advantage could be what saves the company and allows its profits to continue to grow Watch Apple's stock move in real time Since the death of legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs it's become somewhat fashionable to opine about the slow death of Apple The company angered customers by removing the iPhone's headphone jack alienated pro users by not including a standard set of ports on its newest laptops and has struggled to offer a competitive experience with its Siri voice assistant But UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said that looking to another legend Warren Buffett can provide a bit of insight on the future for Apple "Warren Buffett differentiates between franchises and businesses A franchise is based on offerings that are needed thought by customers to have no close substitute and not subject to price regulation " Milunovich wrote in a note to clients "Franchises enjoy such strong economics that they can survive mismanagement If that's true then concerns about Apple losing its mojo post-Jobs could be accurate yet misplaced though we think management is performing well " Buffett recently endorsed Apple by disclosing a 2 6% stake in the company making his Berkshire Hathaway the fifth-largest owner of Apple shares The move notably goes against his famous investing habit of staying away from tech The reason Buffett is so confident in Apple's ability to outperform its rivals comes down to his simple theory of economic moats A company with a wide competitive advantage has a "moat" around its business that can keep other players at an arm's length and give the company room to maneuver It can be argued that despite several recent hardware missteps Apple has maintained and expanded its economic moat Apple customers tend to spend like high-value customers when they step into an Apple store even when they wouldn't exhibit those behaviors at other retailers Milunovich explains Apple's customers are incredibly loyal and show their love by opening their wallets With its $1 000 iPhone X Apple is certainly testing the limits of that theory but even if the new phone hasn't sparked a "supercycle" like some analysts have predicted demand has been strong since launch And Apple is using its economic moat to jumpstart the next big revenue driver for the company which may not come from a new or updated hardware product "Apple says that the vast majority of iPhone users do not purchase its services but once they do that spending increases The company's challenge shifts from attracting users to the ecosystem to emptying their wallets once there " Milunovich said If Apple can start nudging its existing customers to start spending money on services like Apple Music iCloud storage upgrades or Apple Care plans the company can better monetize its loyal user base and pull even more money from them each month Because of its economic moat and loyal customers Milunovich shares Buffett's bullish outlook on Apple

Portfolios Nov 30 17 | About Apple Inc (AAPL) Mark Hibben Long only tech chipmakers software MARKETPLACERethink Technology (12 070 followers) Summary Qualcomm launches an immediate counterstrike to the latest Apple move Apple's latest maneuvers still leave it vulnerable The enemy of my enemy Rethink Technology business briefs for November 30 2017 Qualcomm launches an immediate counterstrike to the latest Apple move Source Qualcomm Periodically I update Rethink Technology subscribers on the Apple (NASDAQ AAPL) vs Qualcomm (NASDAQ QCOM) global legal war since both companies are in the Portfolio Yesterday morning Reuters reported that Apple had filed a set of patent infringement claims of its own to counter those filed by Qualcomm back in July No sooner had I finished my subscription article than I came across a report later in the evening that Qualcomm had filed yet another patent infringement claim with a new set of five patents The new suit which is in addition to what Qualcomm filed in July can be viewed on ScribD That was fast I thought Qualcomm must have had that one ready to go just in case Perhaps not but in so far as patent infringement claims go the battle now appears to be a matter of which company has the deeper and more applicable patent portfolio One can easily imagine that the two companies will trade blows back and forth in the coming months Like the previous suit this one is based on Qualcomm patents that are non-standard essential Standard essential patents (SEPs) are subject to restrictions on the royalties that can be charged so called fair reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) requirements For non-SEPs Qualcomm is free to charge whatever royalties the market will bear The patents in question are certain to have been covered by the license agreements Apple's contract manufacturers had with Qualcomm In abrogating the contracts Apple and its contract manufacturers (CMS) were automatically infringing the patents Apple's latest maneuvers still leave it vulnerable With regard to the licensing contracts that the CMs had with Qualcomm it appears that Apple has badly miscalculated Apple had launched its crusade against Qualcomm while being prevented from knowing the details of the CMs' licensing contracts with Qualcomm by its own admission Qualcomm was in the habit of portfolio licensing in which a large number of SEP and non-SEP patents were bundled under a blanket agreement While there have been regulatory complaints about Qualcomm's bundling of patents to date no jurisdiction has been willing to ban the practice for the simple reason that it's a common practice and there's no legal basis to outlaw it Probably Apple has concluded that as well which is why it has decided that the best defense is a strong offense While this strategy may work in the courts addressing the patent claims it still leaves Apple vulnerable in the ITC investigation The ITC has agreed to investigate Qualcomm's complaint and the ITC will only rule on the narrow scope of the complaint Apple could file a complaint of its own seeking to block the import of smartphones that carry the offending Qualcomm chips But the only logical target of such a complaint would be Samsung (OTC SSNLF) Apple's ally in its dispute with Qualcomm and now the exclusive supplier of iPhone X displays Apple is unlikely to retaliate against Qualcomm through Samsung Apple's patent claims also don't help with Qualcomm's suit against the CMs for breach of contract The defendants are the CMs not Apple and they cannot use Apple's patent infringement claims as part of their defense The enemy of my enemy Apple's most potent weapon in its crusade against Qualcomm may well be its new-found closeness with Intel (NASDAQ INTC) In addition to a report that Apple will use Intel modems exclusively for the next generation iOS devices there is now a new report in Fast Company claiming that Apple and Intel are working closely together on 5G modems While Apple may find it expedient to cooperate with Intel on modems I seriously doubt the conclusion proffered by Fast Company All of this seems to point toward the possibility of Apple looking to Intel as the sole provider of 5G modems for the iPhone The end game multiple sources have said is to build the Intel modem onto an integrated system-on-a-chip (SoC) that would also contain the CPU GPU and other iPhone components The SoC would be co-designed by Intel and Apple and would be fabricated at an Intel facility As I pointed out in my coverage of TSMC's (NYSE TSM) Q3 earnings report TSMC had held a 30th Anniversary celebration and panel discussion which was attended by Apple COO Jeff Williams Williams kicked off his part of the discussion by announcing that TSMC would be Apple's sole foundry partner The cooperation between Apple and Intel is just an indicator of how far behind Qualcomm Intel really is in 5G The 5G patent portfolios amassed by the respective companies will be the important battleground since most 5G modems will be consolidated into mobile SOCs Apple's need to incorporate LTE/5G modems into its SOCs becomes more pressing every year Apple's failure to reach an agreement with Qualcomm on licensing is the genesis of its dispute with Qualcomm The end game for Apple's crusade against Qualcomm is to beat it into submission in time to launch its 5G endowed SOCs Given that this is the case the last thing Qualcomm should do is capitulate to Apple at this stage or allow itself to be acquired by Broadcom (NASDAQ AVGO) so that Broadcom can capitulate on its behalf I believe that Qualcomm's investors are best served if Qualcomm stands its ground against Apple This really is a dispute about the price of intellectual property and Qualcomm obtains the best price by standing up to Apple Both Apple and Qualcomm are part of the Rethink Technology Portfolio (sigh) and carry buy ratings About this article Expand page 1 / 3 | Next » Get

companies will be the important battleground since most 5G modems will be consolidated into mobile SOCs Apple's need to incorporate LTE/5G modems into its SOCs becomes more pressing every year Apple's failure to reach an agreement with Qualcomm on licensing is the genesis of its dispute with Qualcomm The end game for Apple's crusade against Qualcomm is to beat it into submission in time to launch its 5G endowed SOCs Given that this is the case the last thing Qualcomm should do is capitulate to Apple at this stage or allow itself to be acquired by Broadcom (NASDAQ AVGO) so that Broadcom can capitulate on its behalf I believe that Qualcomm's investors are best served if Qualcomm stands its ground against Apple This really is a dispute about the price of intellectual property and Qualcomm

are in the Portfolio Yesterday morning Reuters reported that Apple had filed a set of patent infringement claims of its own to counter those filed by Qualcomm back in July No sooner had I finished my subscription article than I came across a report later in the evening that Qualcomm had filed yet another patent infringement claim with a new set of five patents The new suit which is in addition to what Qualcomm filed in July can be viewed on ScribD That was fast I thought Qualcomm must have had that one ready to go just in case Perhaps not but in so far as patent infringement claims go the battle now appears to be a matter of which company has the deeper and more applicable patent portfolio One can easily imagine that the two companies will trade blows back and forth in the coming months Like the previous suit this one is based on Qualcomm patents that are non-standard essential Standard essential patents (SEPs) are subject to restrictions on the royalties that can be charged so called fair reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) requirements For non-SEPs Qualcomm is free to charge whatever royalties the market will bear The patents in question are certain to have been covered by the license agreements Apple's contract manufacturers had with Qualcomm In abrogating the contracts Apple and its contract manufacturers (CMS) were automatically infringing the patents Apple's latest maneuvers still leave it vulnerable With regard to the licensing contracts that the CMs had with Qualcomm it appears that Apple has badly miscalculated Apple had launched its crusade against Qualcomm while being prevented from knowing the details of the CMs' licensing contracts with Qualcomm by its own admission Qualcomm was in the habit of portfolio licensing in which a large number of SEP and non-SEP patents were bundled under a blanket agreement While there have been regulatory complaints about Qualcomm's bundling of patents to date no jurisdiction has been willing to ban the practice for the simple reason that it's a common practice and there's no legal basis to outlaw it Probably Apple has concluded that as well which is why it has decided that the best defense is a strong offense While this strategy may work in the courts addressing the patent claims it still leaves Apple vulnerable in the ITC investigation The ITC has agreed to investigate Qualcomm's complaint and the ITC will only rule on the narrow scope of the complaint Apple could file a complaint of its own seeking to block the import of smartphones that carry the offending Qualcomm chips But the only logical target of such a complaint would be Samsung (OTC SSNLF) Apple's ally in its dispute with Qualcomm and now the exclusive supplier of iPhone X displays Apple is unlikely to retaliate against Qualcomm through Samsung Apple's patent claims also don't help with Qualcomm's suit against the CMs for breach of contract The defendants are the CMs not Apple and they cannot use Apple's patent infringement claims as part of their defense The enemy of my enemy Apple's most potent weapon in its crusade against Qualcomm may well be its new-found closeness with Intel (NASDAQ INTC) In addition to a report that Apple will use Intel modems exclusively for the next generation iOS devices there is now a new report in Fast Company claiming that Apple and Intel are working closely together on 5G modems While Apple may find it expedient to cooperate with Intel on modems I seriously doubt the conclusion proffered by Fast Company All of this seems to point toward the possibility of Apple looking to Intel as the sole provider of 5G modems for the iPhone The end game multiple sources have said is to build the Intel modem onto an integrated system-on-a-chip (SoC) that would also
