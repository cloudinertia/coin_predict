Dec 11 17 | About Apple Inc (AAPL) Oleh Kombaiev Commodities internet medium-term horizon ETF investing (2 023 followers) Summary Starting from 2012 the average value of the "fair" P/E of Apple has been 18 8 The last two times when the actual P/E of Apple was critically approaching the "fair" P/E ended up with a substantial decline in the value of the company Apple shows a slowdown in earnings per share in combination with a record level of the P/E multiple Investment Thesis The valuation of Apple (AAPL) by comparing the actual values of P/E and "fair" P/E indicates the low potential for further growth of the company's value in the near future In my last article about Apple I mentioned the low potential for further growth of the company’s shares based on the analysis of the price/earnings to growth and price/sales to growth multiples as well as the growth rates of the key financial indicators and DCF-modeling In this post I would like to highlight another factor which alas also indicates that Apple is close to an overbought state It's always useful to analyze the current multiple values of the company in the context of its historic fair value Let me explain with an example In November 2014 Apple’s P/E multiple was x18 5 and the shares’ trading price was $119 In this context the following question has to be answered Assuming that Apple’s shares today are worth $169 how correctly did the P/E multiple reflect the value of the shares in November 2014? To answer this question we need to calculate the "fair" P/E and compare it with the actual one The calculation is simple We assume a cost of equity based on the U S 10-year bond yield plus a 6% equity risk premium and discount back today's price and divide the result by EPS (ttm) corresponding to a specific period in the past So we get "fair" P/E value based on the current share price at a point of time in the past taking into account the acceptable cost of capital I did the calculations and enclosed them here And now let's take a look at the results in the graphical form First and foremost to honor Apple it is worth noting that over the past 10 years the "fair" P/E relative to today's share price was always higher than the actual P/E But there are other patterns Starting from 2012 onwards the "fair" P/E value has settled at the middle level equaling to x19 And during this period besides the current situation the actual P/E of Apple critically approached this average level twice in 2012 and 2015 It is interesting to note that the stages of a significant reduction in the value of Apple started precisely in 2012 and 2015 To date the actual P/E of Apple is 18 4 therefore in my opinion given the history of the last 10 years the desire of investors to buy Apple’s shares cannot be strong I think it is logical because the current P/E is almost equal to the average "fair" P/E over the past five years which means that amid the most probable scenario such an investment would provide only minimum market return This argument is particularly important given that the demonstrated growth of earnings per share Apple is approaching the minimum rate over the past 10 years Putting It All Together So just like in the summary to my previous article I would like to reiterate that I do not predict the fall of Apple’s shares This is a great company with great products and very large balance on its account But like everything in this world the company's development goes in cycles and given the slowdown in the growth of the key financial indicators demonstrated by Apple in conjunction with the record values of its key multiples it is very likely that the next stage of Apple’s development is coming to an end Therefore in the next year we will not see the value of its shares rising above today's level About this article Expand page 1 / 3 | Next » Recommended for you Apple Revisiting My iPhone X Projections D M Martins Research • Dec 13 2017 4 54 AM ET 8 5 Billion Reasons To Buy Apple Stock Andres Cardenal CFA • Dec 12 2017 4 00 AM ET If You Don't Own Any Bitcoin Read This Chris Martenson • Dec 13 2017 3 48 AM ET Apple Valuation Follow-Up Dec 11 17 | About Apple Inc (AAPL) Oleh Kombaiev Commodities internet medium-term horizon ETF investing (2 023 followers) Summary Starting from 2012 the average value of the "fair" P/E of Apple has been 18 8 The last two times when the actual P/E of Apple was critically approaching the "fair" P/E ended up with a substantial decline in the value of the company Apple shows a slowdown in earnings per share in combination with a record level of the P/E multiple Investment Thesis The valuation of Apple (AAPL) by comparing the actual values of P/E and "fair" P/E indicates the low potential for further growth of the company's value in the near future In my last article about Apple I mentioned the low potential for further growth of the company’s shares based on the analysis of the price/earnings to growth and price/sales to growth multiples as well as the growth rates of the key financial indicators and DCF-modeling In this post I would like to highlight another factor which alas also indicates that Apple is close to an overbought state It's always useful to analyze the current multiple values of the company in the context of its historic fair value Let me explain with an example In November 2014 Apple’s P/E multiple was x18 5 and the shares’ trading price was $119 In this context the following question has to be answered Assuming that Apple’s shares today are worth $169 how correctly did the P/E multiple reflect the value of the shares in November 2014?

Billion Reasons To Buy Apple Stock Dec 11 17 | About Apple Inc (AAPL) Andres Cardenal CFA Long/short equity CFA ETF investing macro MARKETPLACEThe Data Driven Investor (3 558 followers) Summary The iPhone generates the lion's share of revenue but the services business is a powerful growth driver for Apple Services generate superior profit margins and more predictable financial performance A growing share of revenue and profits coming from services could drive higher valuation levels for Apple stock When it comes to Apple (AAPL) most of the attention is usually focused on the iPhone since that product generates nearly two thirds of the company’s revenue However the services segment is becoming a key growth engine for the company The services business could offer a lot in terms of sales and profits over the coming years and it also could propel Apple stock to higher valuation levels A Massive Business Growing At Full Speed The services division includes revenue from the iTunes Store the App Store Apple Pay Apple Music and other services This business generated $8 5 billion in sales during the quarter ended in September and it's now the company's second-biggest division behind the iPhone accounting for 16% of total revenue Revenue from services increased by a vigorous 34% year-over-year last quarter These numbers include a favorable one-time revenue adjustment of $640 million On a run rate basis excluding this adjustment services growth was 24% last quarter This is an acceleration vs a 22% growth rate in the June quarter and a 18% increase during the quarter ended in March Apple’s services business is now the size of a Fortune 100 company Putting the numbers in perspective Netflix (NFLX) produced $2 98 billion in revenue last quarter and Amazon (AMZN) is making $4 6 billion in quarterly revenue from Amazon Web Services This shows how Apple’s services division is becoming a massive business on its own merits According to management the App Store set a new all-time record in revenue last quarter and data from App Annie's latest report shows that the App Store is the preferred destination for customer purchases generating nearly twice the revenue of Alphabet´s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Play Across all of its services offerings Apple ended the September quarter with 210 million paying subscribers an increase of 25 million new paying subscribers over the quarter This bodes well for the company in terms of recurring revenue from services going forward Apple does not disclose profit margins for different segments but services typically generate much higher profitability than hardware sales According to estimates from Piper Jaffray in 2015 the services division was generating a gross profit margin around 60% of revenue and those margins were expected to substantially increase over time With all probability the services division will outgrow the rest of the business over the years ahead services will account for an increasingly large share of the total revenue mix at the company level This should have positive implications in terms of growth and profitability for Apple The Strategic Value Of Services Hardware sales are typically quite volatile as they depend on new product launches and other product-cycle considerations Besides the hardware business is highly seasonal focused around the Christmas holiday and new model launch quarters This makes revenue volatile and hard to predict If Apple makes any serious mistakes with new iPhone launches or if the competition manages to reduce the competitive gap this could provide a considerable blow to Apple in the much important iPhone segment Services are a whole different story though Revenue in this segment depends on the size of the installed base and user engagement not so much on product sales over a particular quarter For this reason services provide a far more stable and predictable source of highly profitable revenue for the company This is remarkably important in terms of the overall quality of the company’s financial performance In addition services play a key role in terms of the Apple ecosystem and generating increasing competitive strength for Apple As customers become entrenched in Apple's ecosystem of services and applications they are more likely to remain loyal to the company's products If you are actively engaged with Apple Pay and Apple Music and you are storing many important data and files on iCloud chances are you will buy another iPhone when it's time to renew your smartphone Valuation Implications Apple stock trades at notoriously low valuation ratios in comparison to the average stock in the S&P 500 index Based on earnings over a trailing 12-month period Apple has a price to earnings ratio of 18 4 while the average company in the index carries a price to earnings ratio of 22 7 On a forward looking basis Apple is even cheaper The stock trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 14 9 vs 21 7 for the average company in the S&P 500 One of the main uncertainty factors affecting Apple’s valuation is lack of performance visibility Hardware companies are typically valued at considerable discounts vs the overall market because demand in the industry is unstable and cyclical If Apple proves to investors that it can generate consistent and predictable growth from services this could be a game changer in terms of investor perception about the company In essence Apple is priced like a hardware company but the company is really in the business of selling integrated hardware software and services A growing share of revenue coming from services would make this more evident to investors and Wall Street analysts which should have positive implications in terms of valuation levels for the stock To wrap up the services segment is a huge business firing on all cylinders and it also generates superior profit margins for the company Besides services make financial performance smoother and more predictable

MARKETPLACEThe Data Driven Investor (3 558 followers) Summary The iPhone generates the lion's share of revenue but the services business is a powerful growth driver for Apple Services generate superior profit margins and more predictable financial performance A growing share of revenue and profits coming from services could drive higher valuation levels for Apple stock When it comes to Apple (AAPL) most of the attention is usually focused on the iPhone since that product generates nearly two thirds of the company’s revenue However the services segment is becoming a key growth engine for the company The services business could offer a lot in terms of sales and profits over the coming years and it also could propel Apple stock to higher valuation levels A Massive Business Growing At Full Speed The services division includes revenue from the iTunes Store the App Store Apple Pay Apple Music and other services This business generated $8 5 billion in sales during the quarter ended in September and it's now the company's second-biggest division behind the iPhone accounting for 16% of total revenue Revenue from services increased by a vigorous 34% year-over-year last quarter These numbers include a favorable one-time revenue adjustment of $640 million On a run rate basis excluding this adjustment services growth was 24% last quarter This is an acceleration vs a 22% growth rate in the June quarter and a 18% increase during the quarter ended in March Apple’s services business is now the size of a Fortune 100 company Putting the numbers in perspective Netflix (NFLX) produced $2 98 billion in revenue last quarter and Amazon (AMZN) is making $4 6 billion in quarterly revenue from Amazon Web Services This shows how Apple’s services division is becoming a massive business on its own merits According to management the App Store set a new all-time record in revenue last quarter and data from App Annie's latest report shows that the App Store is the preferred destination for customer purchases generating nearly twice the revenue of Alphabet´s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Play Across all of its services offerings Apple ended the September quarter with 210 million paying subscribers an increase of 25 million new paying subscribers over the quarter This bodes well for the company in terms of recurring revenue from services going forward Apple does not disclose profit margins for different segments but services typically generate much higher profitability than hardware sales According to estimates from Piper Jaffray in 2015 the services division was generating a gross profit margin around 60% of revenue and those margins were expected to substantially increase over time With all probability the services division will outgrow the rest of the business over the years ahead services will account for an increasingly large share of the total revenue mix at the company level This should have positive implications in terms of growth and profitability for Apple The Strategic Value Of Services Hardware sales are typically quite volatile as they depend on new product launches and other product-cycle considerations Besides the hardware business is highly seasonal focused around the Christmas holiday and new model launch quarters This makes revenue volatile and hard to predict If Apple makes any serious mistakes with new iPhone launches or if the competition manages to reduce the competitive gap this could provide a considerable blow to Apple in the much important iPhone segment Services are a whole different story though Revenue in this segment depends on the size of the installed base and user engagement not so much on product sales over a particular quarter For this reason services provide a far more stable and predictable source of highly profitable revenue for the company This is remarkably important in terms of the overall quality of the company’s financial performance In addition services play a key role in terms of the Apple ecosystem and generating increasing competitive strength for Apple As customers become entrenched in Apple's ecosystem of services and applications they are more likely to remain loyal to the company's products If you are actively engaged with Apple Pay and Apple Music and you are storing many important data and files on iCloud chances are you will buy another iPhone when it's

reduce the competitive gap this could provide a considerable blow to Apple in the much important iPhone segment Services are a whole different story though Revenue in this segment depends on the size of the installed base and user engagement not so much on product sales over a particular quarter For this reason services provide a far more stable and predictable source of highly profitable revenue for the company This is remarkably important in terms of the overall quality of the company’s financial performance In addition services play a key role in terms of the Apple ecosystem and generating increasing competitive strength for Apple As customers become entrenched in Apple's ecosystem of services and applications they are more likely to remain loyal to the company's products If you are actively engaged with Apple Pay and Apple Music and you are storing many important data and files on iCloud chances are you will buy another iPhone when it's time to renew your smartphone Valuation Implications Apple stock trades at notoriously low valuation ratios in comparison to the average stock in the S&P 500 index Based on earnings over a trailing 12-month period Apple has a price to earnings ratio of 18 4 while the average company in the index carries a price to earnings ratio of 22 7 On a forward looking basis Apple is even cheaper The stock trades at a forward price to earnings ratio of 14 9 vs 21 7 for the average company in the S&P 500 One of the main uncertainty factors affecting Apple’s valuation is lack of performance visibility Hardware companies are typically valued at considerable discounts vs the overall market because demand in the industry is unstable and cyclical If Apple proves to investors that it can generate consistent and predictable growth from services this could be a game changer in terms of investor perception about the company In essence Apple is priced like a hardware company but the company is really in the business of selling integrated hardware software and services A growing share of revenue coming from services would make this more evident to investors and Wall Street analysts which should have positive implications in terms of valuation levels for the stock To wrap up the services segment is a huge business firing on all cylinders and it also generates superior profit margins for the company Besides services make financial performance smoother and more predictable while also making Apple stronger in terms of competitive strategy Because of these factors a growing share of revenue coming from services could drive higher valuation levels for Apple stock When it comes to Apple (AAPL) most of the attention is usually focused on the iPhone since that product generates nearly two thirds of the company’s revenue However the services segment is becoming a key growth engine for the company The services business could offer a lot in terms of sales and profits over the coming years and it also could propel Apple stock to higher valuation levels A Massive Business Growing At Full Speed The services division includes revenue from the iTunes Store the App Store Apple Pay Apple Music and other services This business generated $8 5 billion in sales during the quarter ended in September and it's now the company's second-biggest division behind the iPhone accounting for 16% of total revenue Revenue from services increased by a vigorous 34% year-over-year last quarter These numbers include a favorable one-time revenue adjustment of $640 million On a run rate basis excluding this adjustment services growth was 24% last quarter This is an acceleration vs a 22% growth rate in the June quarter and a 18% increase during the quarter ended in March Apple’s services business is now the size of a Fortune 100 company Putting the numbers in perspective Netflix (NFLX) produced $2 98 billion in revenue last quarter and Amazon (AMZN) is making $4 6 billion in quarterly revenue from Amazon Web Services This shows how Apple’s services division is becoming a massive business on its own merits According to management the App Store set a new all-time record in revenue last quarter and data from App Annie's latest report shows that the App Store is the preferred destination for customer purchases generating nearly twice the revenue of Alphabet´s (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Play Across all of its services offerings Apple ended the September quarter with 210 million paying subscribers an increase of 25 million new paying subscribers over the quarter This bodes well for the company in terms of recurring revenue from services going forward Apple does not disclose profit margins for different segments but services typically generate much higher profitability than hardware sales According to estimates from Piper Jaffray in 2015 the services division was generating a gross profit margin around 60% of revenue and those margins were expected to substantially increase over time With all probability the services division will outgrow the rest of the business over the years ahead services will account for an increasingly large share of the total revenue mix at the company level This should have positive implications in terms of growth and profitability for Apple The Strategic Value Of Services Hardware sales are typically quite volatile as they depend on new product

If a 5 8 inch iPhone X starts at $999 one would think a 6 5 inch device with a much larger battery is going to start north of that This is especially true when you consider adding new technology like improving the chipset and camera perhaps 4 GB of RAM memory and maybe a storage bump to 128GB - any of those could also send prices higher How much of a market will there be for a phone line that starts at perhaps $1 199 $1 299 or more? If there was a 512GB storage model version you could easily make a case for $1 499 or more At that price you could buy iPhone SEs for an family of four and still have over $100 left Those that have followed the Apple story know that rising prices have been a recent trend Last year the 7 Plus got a $20 bump from the previous generation's Plus model and this year's 8 Plus goes for $30 more than that In percentage terms however we've seen a larger jump for the regular model which at $699 this year goes for $50 more than the base iPhone went in the prior two years That has helped iPhone average selling prices rebound a little as seen in the chart below from the fiscal 2015 year high Things have come down from their peak thanks to the cheaper SE along with Apple deciding this year to sell an extra older generation of phones the 6s line While that provided another option and a more budget friendly one for consumers it did impact iPhone selling prices a bit (Source Apple 10-K filings) Source Apple 10-K filings) 10-K filings Despite the price raises for the 8 and 8 Plus over their prior generation counterparts iPhone average selling prices declined by almost a dollar in Apple's fiscal Q4 period that ended in September compared to the year ago period Thanks to the iPhone X there are a number of analysts looking for iPhone average selling prices to top $700 in the near term Depending on the sales mix they may not get there for the full fiscal 2018 period but at least for Q1 and Q2 they should be above that level Apple's fiscal Q4 Will Apple be able to push the envelope even more in 2018 when it comes to iPhone pricing? While we have heard that an upgraded SE could come it's also possible that more storage in that device leads to a higher starting price than the original version Today however I'm more focused on Apple's main line of iPhones with a new rumor suggesting battery sizes are about to see a large increase With speculation that we'll also see a top end model with a 6 5 inch screen I don't see how the starting price of this device won't be into four figures and potentially approaching $1 500 for some storage versions While that's good for average selling prices is Apple nearing a limit that will see consumers push back?

govt unlikely to give special exemptions - sources * Disagreement could delay Apple expansion in India By Aditya Kalra and Sanjeev Miglani NEW DELHI Dec 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has asked India to defer a planned increase in import taxes on mobile phone parts so it can expand its iPhone manufacturing in the country but the government is unlikely to accede people familiar with the matter said The U S technology giant has been in talks with Indian officials for months seeking "pre-requisites" - government tax breaks and incentives - for expanding its operations in one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets During those talks Apple has conveyed it wants India to defer an existing policy that plans to levy taxes on more imported mobile components in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" drive to boost domestic manufacturing While India's government has been keen to get Apple to manufacture in India as a showpiece investment it has told the U S firm there would be no policy exemptions so there will be no tax breaks on parts imports the people said "Apple wants duty-free imports of components India wants indigenization " said one person with direct knowledge of the talks Apple has expressed willingness to increase local value addition over time but has stuck to its demand for immediate import tax relief to expand its iPhone manufacturing the person added Apple declined to comment and there was no response from either Modi's office or the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology which is trying to help build an electronics manufacturing base NO SPECIAL TREATMENT The disagreement could be a stumbling block and risks delaying Apple's plans to penetrate the Indian market where it currently just assembles its iPhone SE model Despite a boom in smartphone sales in India Apple's market share is only around 2 percent Apple has demanded the tax relief as India still lacks an ideal ecosystem for parts makers to thrive Counterpoint Research data shows that while more than three-quarters of smartphones sold in India are made locally about 90 percent of the $14 billion worth of mobile components are imported To change that scenario India imposes a 10 percent tax on imported components such as batteries chargers and headsets Under a "phased manufacturing programme" (PMP) the government plans to extend the taxes to more components as a way of nudging parts makers to switch to more local production "It's been a chicken-and-egg problem for component suppliers whether to set up manufacturing operations in India " said Neil Shah a director at Counterpoint "Apple and its partners will eventually have to comply otherwise Apple will always price its products at a premium " A previously unreported note prepared by India's IT ministry assessing Apple's demands showed the company sought an exemption from PMP which the ministry said "may not be feasible" Some of Apple's other demands - including capital equipment incentives as well as allowing importing and then exporting phones after repairs - would require policy changes according to the note While the government has publicly said it is still considering Apple's demands the people familiar with the talks said it has made clear it won't make any special concessions "We have told them please come and invest but we cannot do things that go beyond our policies We cannot do things only for you " said one senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter "They are coming around (to our view) " Apple has said it would be able to create 5 000-10 000 jobs in India as and when it expands there the official said (Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Sanjeev Miglani Editing by Ian Geoghegan) SEE ALSO STOCKS HIT A RECORD HIGH Here's what you need

With 2018 fast approaching Markets Insider sat down RBC's Mark Mahaney to find out what could be in store for the tech sector next year Mahaney is one of the most widely respected analysts in the tech space and is rated in the top five analysts by Bloomberg for 14 of the 25 stocks he covers Following is transcript of a phone interview with Mahaney It has been edited for clarity Seth Archer Going into 2018 what are you looking out for what gets you excited and what are you worried about? Mark Mahaney Three things have remained constant about the large-cap internet stocks at least the high-quality ones One of these facts is that revenue growth is extraordinarily consistent The expression we use is 'insanely consistent' in our last earnings preview Google Amazon Facebook Netflix - all four of the FANGs - have had almost the exact same growth rate in '17 '16 and '15 Facebook has faded a little bit but it's faded from like 60 down to high 40 I've been struck by how consistent the growth rates have been I've also been struck by how consistent the aggressive investment has been by these companies All these companies have been spending aggressively on new areas of growth whether it's Netflix spending more money on original content and expanding internationally whether its Amazon spending more money on buying Whole Foods and on distribution centers for its retail business and data centers for its cloud business whether it's Facebook investing aggressively into artificial intelligence and machine learning and into video content And Google is still aggressively investing in cloud - also into its projects like autonomous vehicles The investment outlook remains aggressive for all four of those companies and the revenue growth has remained very consistent And the third thing that is constant is really the multiples The valuations on these names are very similar to where they were two years ago The multiples have either held or have come down It’s interesting They've had three years in a row of dramatic market outperformance It's not been due to a multiple rerating That would typically be it you'd expect It's been entirely been due to earnings growth The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Justin Sullivan/Getty Images So those are the three constants As I think about '18 I don't see a reason why the fundamental trends behind the leading internet platforms so I call them "PEFANG" Priceline Expedia FANG I don't think there is any reason - except for the online travel names - I don't think there is any reason to expect a change either a material change in their revenue growth or in their aggressive investment outlook And the multiples It’s sort of interesting I feel less conviction about the multiples than I do about the fundamentals of the company Because I feel like the fundamentals are extremely intact and since multiples have been very consistent the last three years I don't know why they wouldn't be this year But as a stock picker I would worry about if there's a rotation out of growth into value Then clearly no matter how high quality they are the internet names would underperform if there's a material rotation out of growth into value Archer So you are worried about multiples going down not them going higher right? Mahaney Yeah I guess that's right I don't think that given where the multiples are I don't know that there's room for a lot of correction in the multiples But I could see the multiples go down by a couple of points on each of the names as a part of the trade rotation out of growth and into value That's a risk that I would think about I think the high-quality internet names they probably face portfolio risk I don't foresee any particular macro risk and I don't see any particular fundamentals risk You know famous last words - but they've been very consistent the last three years REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Archer You mentioned government regulations Does that come to a head in 2018 and how does that affect earnings? Mahaney I don't know if it comes to a head but there's no doubt that there is greater regulatory scrutiny of these names OK maybe not Netflix - but Google Amazon and Facebook There's no doubt that there's greater public and regulatory scrutiny now than there was 12 and 24 months ago And it's not only that but there's been actual regulatory action taken against Google in the EU And there are two more investigations that the EU is undergoing I'm skeptical that the regulatory public scrutiny will lead to either a material change in their revenue growth outlooks or in their cost structures But the latter is a possibility It's possible that they are going to have to spend more money to comply with regulations Whether that's data-privacy regulations like those that are going to be imposed by the EU in 2018 that could lead to a rise in their cost structure I don't think it would be material but it's possible Facebook - one of the reasons they are going to be accelerating their expense growth in '18 is the need to spend more on security because of the Russian hacking of the US elections So that's an odd expense I don't know if that really falls under scrutiny except that it was public scrutiny that made Facebook get more aggressive about it I guess that's probably the biggest variable I can think of Does regulatory and public scrutiny cause their operating costs to rise more aggressively than they would otherwise? That to me is one of the most interesting changes A couple of other trends I find interesting in the group are the increasing focus on AI and machine learning It's very hard to see that impact from a financial perspective it's hard to find their line in the P&L that says this is artificial intelligence but it's in there in terms of the expenses And it should be in there in the form of more relevant and more effective services I guess that's point one The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Point two is I'm very intrigued by what I call the "voiceification" of the internet It's not only in emerging markets I'm not certain on this that voice is much more of a user interface an application-interaction method than in the developing markets And more and more of the growth of the internet is in developing markets In the US that will essentially carry the internet or bring the internet into the car and the kitchen I'm thinking about Alexa devices Google Home devices the HomePod by Apple whenever that comes out So I think about that It's not the most important platform shift of the last five years or next five years It's still going to be smartphones But voiceification could also move the needle - not exactly as smartphones did but it will move the needle Archer And does AI move that needle? You said it's hard to see Mahaney Yes it must It's one of those "submarine trends " It's impacting the tides but it’s below the surface so it's very hard to see it Read more about how tech is in the crosshairs of regulators here SEE ALSO STOCKS HIT A RECORD HIGH Here's what you need to know » READ NOW India is buying world's emptiest airport in its battle for territorial dominance with China » SHARE THIS POST FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL COPY LINK by Taboola Sponsored Links RECOMMENDED FROM THE WEB Cinemas Worrying About These Tiny Projectors NanaHD 14 Billionaires With Gorgeous Wives & Exs Hooch Father and Son Take the Same Photo For 27 Years!

Mark Mahaney Three things have remained constant about the large-cap internet stocks at least the high-quality ones One of these facts is that revenue growth is extraordinarily consistent The expression we use is 'insanely consistent' in our last earnings preview Google Amazon Facebook Netflix - all four of the FANGs - have had almost the exact same growth rate in '17 '16 and '15 Facebook has faded a little bit but it's faded from like 60 down to high 40 I've been struck by how consistent the growth rates have been I've also been struck by how consistent the aggressive investment has been by these companies All these companies have been spending aggressively on new areas of growth whether it's Netflix spending more money on original content and expanding internationally whether its Amazon spending more money on buying Whole Foods and on distribution centers for its retail business and data centers for its cloud business whether it's Facebook investing aggressively into artificial intelligence and machine learning and into video content And Google is still aggressively investing in cloud - also into its projects like autonomous vehicles The investment outlook remains aggressive for all four of those companies and the revenue growth has remained very consistent And the third thing that is constant is really the multiples The valuations on these names are very similar to where they were two years ago The multiples have either held or have come down It’s interesting They've had three years in a row of dramatic market outperformance It's not been due to a multiple rerating That would typically be it you'd expect It's been entirely been due to earnings growth The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Justin Sullivan/Getty Images So those are the three constants As I think about '18 I don't see a reason why the fundamental trends behind the leading internet platforms so I call them "PEFANG" Priceline Expedia FANG I don't think there is any reason - except for the online travel names - I don't think there is any reason to expect a change either a material change in their revenue growth or in their aggressive investment outlook And the multiples It’s sort of interesting I feel less conviction about the multiples than I do about the fundamentals of the company Because I feel like the fundamentals are extremely intact and since multiples have been very consistent the last three years I don't know why they wouldn't be this year But as a stock picker I would worry about if there's a rotation out of growth into value Then clearly no matter how high quality they are the internet names would underperform if there's a material rotation out of growth into value Archer So you are worried about multiples going down not them going higher right? Mahaney Yeah I guess that's right I don't think that given where the multiples are I don't know that there's room for a lot of correction in the multiples But I could see the multiples go down by a couple of points on each of the names as a part of the trade rotation out of growth and into value That's a risk that I would think about I think the high-quality internet names they probably face portfolio risk I don't foresee any particular macro risk and I don't see any particular fundamentals risk You know famous last words - but they've been very consistent the last three years REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Archer You mentioned government regulations Does that come to a head in 2018 and how does that affect earnings? Mahaney I don't know if it comes to a head but there's no doubt that there is greater regulatory scrutiny of these names OK maybe not Netflix - but Google Amazon and Facebook There's no doubt that there's greater public and regulatory scrutiny now than there was 12 and 24 months ago And it's not only that but there's been actual regulatory action taken against Google in the EU And there are two more investigations that the EU is undergoing I'm skeptical that the regulatory public scrutiny will lead to either a material change in their revenue growth outlooks or in their cost structures But the latter is a possibility It's possible that they are going to have to spend more money to comply with regulations Whether that's data-privacy regulations like those that are going to be imposed by the EU in 2018 that could lead to a rise in their cost structure I don't think it would be material but it's possible Facebook - one of the reasons they are going to be accelerating their expense growth in '18 is the need to spend more on security because of the Russian hacking of the US elections So that's an odd expense I don't know if that really falls under scrutiny except that it was public scrutiny that made Facebook get more aggressive about it I guess that's probably the biggest variable I can think of Does regulatory and public scrutiny cause their operating costs to rise more aggressively than they would otherwise? That to me is one of the most interesting changes A couple of other trends I find interesting in the group are the increasing focus on AI and machine learning It's very hard to see that impact from a financial perspective it's hard to find their line in the P&L that says this is artificial intelligence but it's in there in terms of the expenses And it should be in there in the form of more relevant and more effective services I guess that's point one The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Point two is I'm very intrigued by what I call the "voiceification" of the internet It's not only in emerging markets I'm not certain on this that voice is much more of a user interface an application-interaction method than in the developing markets And more and more of the growth of the internet is in developing markets In the US that will essentially carry the internet or bring the internet into the car and the kitchen I'm thinking about Alexa devices Google Home devices the HomePod by Apple whenever that comes out So I think about that It's not the most important platform shift of the last five years or next five years It's still going to be smartphones But voiceification could also move the needle - not exactly as smartphones did but it will move the needle Archer And does AI move that needle?

With 2018 fast approaching Markets Insider sat down RBC's Mark Mahaney to find out what could be in store for the tech sector next year Mahaney is one of the most widely respected analysts in the tech space and is rated in the top five analysts by Bloomberg for 14 of the 25 stocks he covers Following is transcript of a phone interview with Mahaney It has been edited for clarity Seth Archer Going into 2018 what are you looking out for what gets you excited and what are you worried about? Mark Mahaney Three things have remained constant about the large-cap internet stocks at least the high-quality ones One of these facts is that revenue growth is extraordinarily consistent The expression we use is 'insanely consistent' in our last earnings preview Google Amazon Facebook Netflix - all four of the FANGs - have had almost the exact same growth rate in '17 '16 and '15 Facebook has faded a little bit but it's faded from like 60 down to high 40 I've been struck by how consistent the growth rates have been I've also been struck by how consistent the aggressive investment has been by these companies All these companies have been spending aggressively on new areas of growth whether it's Netflix spending more money on original content and expanding internationally whether its Amazon spending more money on buying Whole Foods and on distribution centers for its retail business and data centers for its cloud business whether it's Facebook investing aggressively into artificial intelligence and machine learning and into video content And Google is still aggressively investing in cloud - also into its projects like autonomous vehicles The investment outlook remains aggressive for all four of those companies and the revenue growth has remained very consistent And the third thing that is constant is really the multiples The valuations on these names are very similar to where they were two years ago The multiples have either held or have come down It’s interesting They've had three years in a row of dramatic market outperformance It's not been due to a multiple rerating That would typically be it you'd expect It's been entirely been due to earnings growth The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Justin Sullivan/Getty Images So those are the three constants As I think about '18 I don't see a reason why the fundamental trends behind the leading internet platforms so I call them "PEFANG" Priceline Expedia FANG I don't think there is any reason - except for the online travel names - I don't think there is any reason to expect a change either a material change in their revenue growth or in their aggressive investment outlook And the multiples It’s sort of interesting I feel less conviction about the multiples than I do about the fundamentals of the company Because I feel like the fundamentals are extremely intact and since multiples have been very consistent the last three years I don't know why they wouldn't be this year But as a stock picker I would worry about if there's a rotation out of growth into value Then clearly no matter how high quality they are the internet names would underperform if there's a material rotation out of growth into value Archer So you are worried about multiples going down not them going higher right? Mahaney Yeah I guess that's right I don't think that given where the multiples are I don't know that there's room for a lot of correction in the multiples But I could see the multiples go down by a couple of points on each of the names as a part of the trade rotation out of growth and into value That's a risk that I would think about I think the high-quality internet names they probably face portfolio risk I don't foresee any particular macro risk and I don't see any particular fundamentals risk You know famous last words - but they've been very consistent the last three years REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Archer You mentioned government regulations Does that come to a head in 2018 and how does that affect earnings? Mahaney I don't know if it comes to a head but there's no doubt that there is greater regulatory scrutiny of these names OK maybe not Netflix - but Google Amazon and Facebook There's no doubt that there's greater public and regulatory scrutiny now than there was 12 and 24 months ago And it's not only that but there's been actual regulatory action taken against Google in the EU And there are two more investigations that the EU is undergoing I'm skeptical that the regulatory public scrutiny will lead to either a material change in their revenue growth outlooks or in their cost structures But the latter is a possibility It's possible that they are going to have to spend more money to comply with regulations Whether that's data-privacy regulations like those that are going to be imposed by the EU in 2018 that could lead to a rise in their cost structure I don't think it would be material but it's possible Facebook - one of the reasons they are going to be accelerating their expense growth in '18 is the need to spend more on security because of the Russian hacking of the US elections So that's an odd expense I don't know if that really falls under scrutiny except that it was public scrutiny that made Facebook get more aggressive about it I guess that's probably the biggest variable I can think of Does regulatory and public scrutiny cause their operating costs to rise more aggressively than they would otherwise? That to me is one of the most interesting changes A couple of other trends I find interesting in the group are the increasing focus on AI and machine learning It's very hard to see that impact from a financial perspective it's hard to find their line in the P&L that says this is artificial intelligence but it's in there in terms of the expenses And it should be in there in the form of more relevant and more effective services I guess that's point one The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Point two is I'm very intrigued by what I call the "voiceification" of the internet It's not only in emerging markets I'm not certain on this that voice is much more of a user interface an application-interaction method than in the developing markets And more and more of the growth of the internet is in developing markets In the US that will essentially carry the internet or bring the internet into the car and the kitchen I'm thinking about Alexa devices Google Home devices the HomePod by Apple whenever that comes out So I think about that It's not the most important platform shift of the last five years or next five years It's still going to be smartphones But voiceification could also move the needle - not exactly as smartphones did but it will move the needle Archer And does AI move that needle?

the broader market by a wide margin in 2017 But it wasn't all smooth sailing as many of the largest companies faced public and regulatory scrutiny along with company-level issues Mark Mahaney an analyst at RBC Capital Markets told Markets Insider that he sees little risk to the future growth of the largest tech companies Tech has been the fastest-growing sector this year with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 nearly doubling the gains of the S&P 500 But tech has made its share of negative headlines this year Facebook and Google have been facing investigations over their roles in allowing foreign influence in the 2016 presidential elections Additionally Apple has seen highly mixed results to its newest editions of the iPhone As the EU cracks down on tax evasion and anticompetitive practices by tech companies in its member states American lawmakers have started to ponder regulating or even breaking up some of the big tech companies As the capabilities of AI programs skyrocket and tech companies successfully automate more human jobs anxiety over the future of work in the US seems to grow with the market cap of many of the tech giants But is it all doom and gloom for some of the world's largest companies? With 2018 fast approaching Markets Insider sat down RBC's Mark Mahaney to find out what could be in store for the tech sector next year Mahaney is one of the most widely respected analysts in the tech space and is rated in the top five analysts by Bloomberg for 14 of the 25 stocks he covers Following is transcript of a phone interview with Mahaney It has been edited for clarity Seth Archer Going into 2018 what are you looking out for what gets you excited and what are you worried about?

Mark Mahaney Three things have remained constant about the large-cap internet stocks at least the high-quality ones One of these facts is that revenue growth is extraordinarily consistent The expression we use is 'insanely consistent' in our last earnings preview Google Amazon Facebook Netflix - all four of the FANGs - have had almost the exact same growth rate in '17 '16 and '15 Facebook has faded a little bit but it's faded from like 60 down to high 40 I've been struck by how consistent the growth rates have been I've also been struck by how consistent the aggressive investment has been by these companies All these companies have been spending aggressively on new areas of growth whether it's Netflix spending more money on original content and expanding internationally whether its Amazon spending more money on buying Whole Foods and on distribution centers for its retail business and data centers for its cloud business whether it's Facebook investing aggressively into artificial intelligence and machine learning and into video content And Google is still aggressively investing in cloud - also into its projects like autonomous vehicles The investment outlook remains aggressive for all four of those companies and the revenue growth has remained very consistent And the third thing that is constant is really the multiples The valuations on these names are very similar to where they were two years ago The multiples have either held or have come down It’s interesting They've had three years in a row of dramatic market outperformance It's not been due to a multiple rerating That would typically be it you'd expect It's been entirely been due to earnings growth The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Justin Sullivan/Getty Images So those are the three constants As I think about '18 I don't see a reason why the fundamental trends behind the leading internet platforms so I call them "PEFANG" Priceline Expedia FANG I don't think there is any reason - except for the online travel names - I don't think there is any reason to expect a change either a material change in their revenue growth or in their aggressive investment outlook And the multiples It’s sort of interesting I feel less conviction about the multiples than I do about the fundamentals of the company Because I feel like the fundamentals are extremely intact and since multiples have been very consistent the last three years I don't know why they wouldn't be this year But as a stock picker I would worry about if there's a rotation out of growth into value Then clearly no matter how high quality they are the internet names would underperform if there's a material rotation out of growth into value Archer So you are worried about multiples going down not them going higher right? Mahaney Yeah I guess that's right I don't think that given where the multiples are I don't know that there's room for a lot of correction in the multiples But I could see the multiples go down by a couple of points on each of the names as a part of the trade rotation out of growth and into value That's a risk that I would think about I think the high-quality internet names they probably face portfolio risk I don't foresee any particular macro risk and I don't see any particular fundamentals risk You know famous last words - but they've been very consistent the last three years REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Archer You mentioned government regulations Does that come to a head in 2018 and how does that affect earnings? Mahaney I don't know if it comes to a head but there's no doubt that there is greater regulatory scrutiny of these names OK maybe not Netflix - but Google Amazon and Facebook There's no doubt that there's greater public and regulatory scrutiny now than there was 12 and 24 months ago And it's not only that but there's been actual regulatory action taken against Google in the EU And there are two more investigations that the EU is undergoing I'm skeptical that the regulatory public scrutiny will lead to either a material change in their revenue growth outlooks or in their cost structures But the latter is a possibility It's possible that they are going to have to spend more money to comply with regulations Whether that's data-privacy regulations like those that are going to be imposed by the EU in 2018 that could lead to a rise in their cost structure I don't think it would be material but it's possible Facebook - one of the reasons they are going to be accelerating their expense growth in '18 is the need to spend more on security because of the Russian hacking of the US elections So that's an odd expense I don't know if that really falls under scrutiny except that it was public scrutiny that made Facebook get more aggressive about it I guess that's probably the biggest variable I can think of Does regulatory and public scrutiny cause their operating costs to rise more aggressively than they would otherwise? That to me is one of the most interesting changes A couple of other trends I find interesting in the group are the increasing focus on AI and machine learning It's very hard to see that impact from a financial perspective it's hard to find their line in the P&L that says this is artificial intelligence but it's in there in terms of the expenses And it should be in there in the form of more relevant and more effective services I guess that's point one The stocks have gone up because the earnings have gone up and the earnings have gone up because the revenue growth has been consistent Point two is I'm very intrigued by what I call the "voiceification" of the internet It's not only in emerging markets I'm not certain on this that voice is much more of a user interface an application-interaction method than in the developing markets And more and more of the growth of the internet is in developing markets In the US that will essentially carry the internet or bring the internet into the car and the kitchen I'm thinking about Alexa devices Google Home devices the HomePod by Apple whenever that comes out So I think about that It's not the most important platform shift of the last five years or next five years It's still going to be smartphones But voiceification could also move the needle - not exactly as smartphones did but it will move the needle Archer And does AI move that needle?

SERVICES TECHNOLOGY STOCKS BUZZ Home Financial Unusual Volume summary on Apple Inc (AAPL) Financial Unusual Volume summary on Apple Inc (AAPL) By Miguel Arevalo -11th December 2017016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Technical analysis of Apple Inc (AAPL) stock Technical analysis of Apple Inc (AAPL) stock includes study of technical indicators and past trends For technical analysis of stock and trends here we employ the use of tools such as trading volume Simple Moving averages RSI (14) and ATR (14) to determine the future behavior of a stock Much of this practice involves discovering the overall trend line of a stock’s movement Technical analysis of stocks and trends has been used by serious traders for decades Although it does not guarantee success and is not 100% accurate it is still one of the two key methods of analyzing stock prices along with fundamental analysis Apple Inc (AAPL) – Unusual Volume Activity on Friday Watch List On Friday Dec 08 Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL) were valued at $169 37 and moved 0 03% A total volume of 23 28 million shares were traded unusually versus to average volume of 28 9 million shares Unusual volume shows something has likely happened in the stock–such as a news release or traders have become worried or euphoric about the stock’s potential A volume “spike” where volume is way more than normal–5 to 10 times (or more) average volume (for that time or period) for example–could indicate the end of a trend These are called exhaustion moves because typically when so many shares change hands there is no one left to keep pushing the price in the trending direction and it reverses (often quickly) If you are going to be trading the stock you want to ensure volume is healthy so you are not stuck in a position Volumes indicate how many shares are bought and sold over a given period of time The more active the share higher would be its volume Technical analysts believe that volume can serve as a warning signal as to whether a stock is on the verge of breaking into upside territory (high volume) or into a downside trend (low volume) Low volume of a security even if it’s rising in price can indicate a lack of conviction among investors Conversely high volume of a particular security can indicate that traders are placing their long-term confidence in the investment Volume is incredibly important to traders Without volume it becomes more difficult to buy or sell securities when you want to and at the price you want Simple Moving averages Chart patterns can be difficult to read given the volatility in price movements of AAPL Moving averages can help smooth out these erratic movements by removing day-to-day fluctuations and make trends easier to spot Since they take the average of past price movements moving averages are better for accurately reading past price movements rather than predicting future past movements We have taken technical analysis of Apple Inc (AAPL)’s stock recent trading price and 3 moving average price of updated past trading days (20 50 and 200) It shows a stock price recent trends and movement that can help investor and traders in trading Moving average is popular technical tool and can be customized to any time frame suiting both long term investors and short-term traders In terms of Apple Inc (AAPL) stock price comparison to its moving averages shares of company are 2 66% away from the 50-day moving average and -1 43% away from 20-day average If we take a long term observation shares have been trading at a distance of 10 42% from the 200-day moving average Moving averages are used as a strong indicator for technical stock analysis and it helps investors in figuring out where the stock has been and also facilitate in determining where it may be possibly heading There can be no complete understanding of moving averages without an understanding of trends A trend is simply a price that is continuing to move in a certain direction There are only three real trends that a security can follow (1) An uptrend or bullish trend means that the price is moving higher (2) A downtrend or bearish trend means the price is moving lower (3) A sideways trend where the price is moving sideways The important thing to remember about trends is that prices rarely move in a straight line Therefore moving-average lines are used to help a trader more easily identify the direction of the trend 52 week High and Low Apple Inc (AAPL) shares have been seen trading -3 90% off its 52 week- peak value and changed 53 14% from its 52 week-bottom price value The “percentage off the 52-week high or low” refers to when a stock current price is relative to where it has traded over the last 52 weeks This gives investors an idea of how much the security has moved in the last year and whether it is trading near the top middle or bottom of the range Relative Strength Index (RSI) Apple Inc (AAPL)’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 49 89 RSI is a technical indicator of price momentum comparing the size of recent gains to the size of recent losses and establishes oversold and overbought positions Technical analysts have little regard for the value of a company They use historic price data to observe stock price patterns to predict the direction of that price going forward Analysts use common formulas and ratios to accomplish this The Relative Strength Index (RSI) developed by J Welles Wilder is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 A value between 0 and 30 is considered oversold hence the trader should look at buying opportunities A value between 70 and 100 is considered overbought hence the trader should look at selling opportunities Performance Apple Inc (AAPL) held 5 15 billion outstanding shares currently The company have shares float of 5 13 billion Now have a look at past performance (weekly performance to year to date performance) how Apple Inc (AAPL) has been moved whether it performed well or not AAPL reported a change of -0 98% over the last week and performed -3 90% over the last month while its year to date (YTD) performance revealed an activity trend of 46 24% The stock’s quarterly performance specifies a shift of 4 87% and its last twelve month performance is stands at 51 06% while moved 16 47% for the past six months Volatility Average True Range (14) for Apple Inc (AAPL) is stands at 2 82 ATR is a volatility indicator Volatility measures the strength of the price action and is often overlooked for clues on market direction The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data Simply a stock experiencing a high level of volatility has a higher ATR and a low volatility stock has a lower ATR The ATR may be used by market technicians to enter and exit trades and it is a useful tool to add to a trading system It was created to allow traders to more accurately measure the daily volatility of an asset by using simple calculations The indicator does not indicate the price direction rather it is used primarily to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves Typically the Average True Range (ATR) is based on 14 periods Over the past week the company showed volatility of 1 61% Moving out to look at the previous month volatility move the stock is at 1 41% A stock with a price that fluctuates wildly hits new highs and lows or moves erratically is considered highly volatile A stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility A highly volatile stock is inherently riskier but that risk cuts both ways When investing in a volatile security the risk of success is increased just as much as the risk of failure For this reason many traders with a high risk tolerance look to multiple measures of volatility to help inform their trade strategies When selecting a security for investment traders look at its historical volatility to help determine the relative risk of a potential trade There are numerous metrics that measure volatility in differing contexts and each trader has favorites Regardless of which metric you utilize a firm understanding of the concept of volatility and how it is measured is essential to successful investing Simply put volatility is a reflection of the degree to which price moves Beta measures volatility or systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole 1 shows stock moves with market < 1 means less volatile than market > 1 indicates more volatile than the market The stock’s beta

analyzing stock prices along with fundamental analysis Apple Inc (AAPL) – Unusual Volume Activity on Friday Watch List On Friday Dec 08 Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL) were valued at $169 37 and moved 0 03% A total volume of 23 28 million shares were traded unusually versus to average volume of 28 9 million shares Unusual volume shows something has likely happened in the stock–such as a news release or traders have become worried or euphoric about the stock’s potential A volume “spike” where volume is way more than normal–5 to 10 times (or more) average volume (for that time or period) for example–could indicate the end of a trend These are called exhaustion moves because typically when so many shares change hands there is no one left to keep pushing the price in the trending direction and it reverses (often quickly) If you are going to be trading the stock you want to ensure volume is healthy so you are not stuck in a position Volumes indicate how many shares are bought and sold over a given period of time The more active the share higher would be its volume Technical analysts believe that volume can serve as a warning signal as to whether a stock is on the verge of breaking into upside territory (high volume) or into a downside trend (low volume) Low volume of a security even if it’s rising in price can indicate a lack of conviction among investors Conversely high volume of a particular security can indicate that traders are placing their long-term confidence in the investment Volume is incredibly important to traders Without volume it becomes more difficult to buy or sell securities when you want to and at the price you want Simple Moving averages Chart patterns can be difficult to read given the volatility in price movements of AAPL Moving averages can help smooth out these erratic movements by removing day-to-day fluctuations and make trends easier to spot Since they take the average of past price movements moving averages are better for accurately

and -1 43% away from 20-day average If we take a long term observation shares have been trading at a distance of 10 42% from the 200-day moving average Moving averages are used as a strong indicator for technical stock analysis and it helps investors in figuring out where the stock has been and also facilitate in determining where it may be possibly heading There can be no complete understanding of moving averages without an understanding of trends A trend is simply a price that is continuing to move in a certain direction There are only three real trends that a security can follow (1) An uptrend or bullish trend means that the price is moving higher (2) A downtrend or bearish trend means the price is moving lower (3) A sideways trend where the price is moving sideways The important thing to remember about trends is that prices rarely move in a straight line Therefore moving-average lines are used to help a trader more easily identify the direction of the trend 52 week High and Low Apple Inc (AAPL) shares have been seen trading -3 90% off its 52 week- peak value and changed 53 14% from its 52 week-bottom price value The “percentage off the 52-week high or low” refers to when a stock current price is relative to where it has traded over the last 52 weeks This gives investors an idea of how much the security has moved in the last year and whether it is trading near the top middle or bottom of the range Relative Strength Index (RSI) Apple Inc (AAPL)’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 49 89 RSI is a technical indicator of price momentum comparing the size of recent gains

patterns to predict the direction of that price going forward Analysts use common formulas and ratios to accomplish this The Relative Strength Index (RSI) developed by J Welles Wilder is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 A value between 0 and 30 is considered oversold hence the trader should look at buying

82 ATR is a volatility indicator Volatility measures the strength of the price action and is often overlooked for clues on market direction The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data Simply a stock experiencing a high level of volatility has a higher ATR and a low volatility stock has a lower ATR The ATR may be used by market technicians to enter and exit trades and it is a useful tool to add to a trading system It was created to allow traders to more accurately measure the daily volatility of an asset by using simple calculations The indicator does
