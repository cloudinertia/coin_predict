Options for AAPL December 04 2017 12 02 43 PM EDT By StockOptionsChannel com BNK Invest Shutterstock photo Consistently one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Apple Inc (Symbol AAPL) So this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the January 2018 expiration for AAPL The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the $165 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2 60 Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1 6% return against the $165 commitment or a 12 5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ) Selling a put does not give an investor access to AAPL's upside potential the way owning shares would because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised So unless Apple Inc sees its shares fall 3 5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $162 40 per share before broker commissions subtracting the $2 60 from $165) the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 12 5% annualized rate of return Interestingly that annualized 12 5% figure actually exceeds the 1 5% annualized dividend paid by Apple Inc by 11% based on the current share price of $171 03 And yet if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 3 53% to reach the $165 strike price Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that in general dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company In the case of Apple Inc looking at the dividend history chart for AAPL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1 5% annualized dividend yield Turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2018 expiration for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1 5% annualized dividend yield Selling the covered call at the $175 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3 40 bid annualizes to an additional 15 8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ) for a total of 17 2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away Any upside above $175 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but AAPL shares would have to advance 2 3% from current levels for that to happen meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 4 3% return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Apple Inc highlighting in green where the $165 strike is located relative to that history and highlighting the $175 strike in red The chart above and the stock's historical volatility can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Apple Inc (considering the last 252 trading day AAPL historical stock prices using closing values as well as today's price of $171 03) to be 17% In mid-afternoon trading on Monday the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1 18M contracts with call volume at 2 40M for a put call ratio of 0 49 so far for the
