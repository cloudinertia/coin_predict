FAAMG and Alibaba (NYSE BABA) And here's what I've got BABA As you can see the result of Apple turned out to be the highest in both multiples which means the maximum balanced price of its shares does not exceed $123 Let's move on and look at how the growth of Apple's financial indicators relate to the current level of its multiples Let's start with EPS and P/E growth rates In the calendar Q3 the three-year CAGR EPS (ttm) diluted amounted to 12 68% - this is the second worst result of Apple over the past ten years And at the same time the current P/E multiple is the highest since the year 2008 This is an apparent inconsistency indicating the reassessment of the company The situation with EBITDA is approximately the same A four-year CAGR of this indicator in the last quarter rose to 7 63% which is very close to the historical minimum values However EV/EBITDA is at the level of the year when the four-year CAGR of EBITDA amounted to more than 60% Finally the growth rate of Apple's OpFCF in the last quarter was the second worst in the history of the company and EV/OpFCF multiple rose to the maximum recorded over the last 7 years As we can see in terms of growth of EPS EBITDA and OpFCF the market has been chronically overestimating Apple in the last few years Now let's see what the DCF analysis says about the fair price of Apple In July I described in detail the building of my DCF-model for Apple based on the prospects of the global smartphone market In this article I will update these calculations described First of all it is worth noting that the results of the last quarter and the release of the new line of Apple products raised the expectations regarding the future revenue of the company expectations Here's what they were like in July Here's what they look like now Accordingly I had to adjust Apple's revenue predictions for the next 10 years Here is the actual WACC calculation Note that the current 1-y Beta Coefficient of Apple is 1 26 which is very close to the historical maximum of the year 2005 The bigger beta means greater systematic risk which is negative for the company and indicates high short-term speculative interest in the shares of the company negative I assume that Apple's operating margin will gradually decrease to the level of 23% due to the increased competition AAPL Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Here's the model itself The DCF-based target price of Apple's shares is $199 offering 14% upside offering 14% upside Putting It All Together Thus Apple is overvalued in two out of three analyses and the result of only one analysis gives more or less fair price estimation I perfectly understand that Apple's dividend policy and the generous buyback program provide a good support for shares However in my opinion the chronically over-the-top multiples amid record-low growth rates of Apple's key financial indicators are not the best combination for shares in wait for rapid and stable growth Disclosure I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours Disclosure I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha) I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article About this article Expand About this article Expand Author payment $35 + $0 01/page view Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500 Tagged Technology Personal Computers EarningsWant to share your opinion on this article?

ahead in 2018 We were asked to also provide an update on an earlier article about Apple's Services and how that's evolved in 2017 So let's just summarize that by saying 2 to 1 What's 2 to 1? Well if you exclude the iPhone for every $1 in profit Apple generated in selling all other products in 2017 (be it iPads Macs Airpods Beats headphones Apple TVs etc ) the company generated almost $2 in profit from Apple Services Services in 4 Pictures Since a picture is worth a 1 000 words let's see if we can save you the trouble of reading Here's Apple's revenue by product line and overall gross profit Now notice that Apple earned an $88B gross profit in 2017?
