Interesting January 2019 Stock Options for MSFT November 27 2017 11 59 52 AM EDT By StockOptionsChannel com BNK Invest Shutterstock photo Consistently one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Microsoft Corporation (Symbol MSFT) So this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the January 2019 expiration for MSFT The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the $72 50 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3 05 Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4 2% return against the $72 50 commitment or a 3 7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ) Selling a put does not give an investor access to MSFT's upside potential the way owning shares would because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised So unless Microsoft Corporation sees its shares fall 13 5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $69 45 per share before broker commissions subtracting the $3 05 from $72 50) the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3 7% annualized rate of return Worth considering is that the annualized 3 7% figure actually exceeds the 2% annualized dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation by 1 7% based on the current share price of $83 78 And yet if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 13 46% to reach the $72 50 strike price Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that in general dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company In the case of Microsoft Corporation looking at the dividend history chart for MSFT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annualized dividend yield Turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration for shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (Symbol MSFT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2% annualized dividend yield Selling the covered call at the $95 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3 30 bid annualizes to an additional 3 5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ) for a total of 5 5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away Any upside above $95 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but MSFT shares would have to advance 13 4% from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 17 3% return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Microsoft Corporation highlighting in green where the $72 50 strike is located relative to that history and highlighting the $95 strike in red The chart above and the stock's historical volatility can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microsoft Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day MSFT historical stock prices using closing values as well as today's price of $83 78) to be 14% In mid-afternoon trading on Monday the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854 085 contracts with call volume at 1 49M for a put call ratio of 0 57 so far for the day Compared to the long-term median put call ratio of 65 that represents

watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Microsoft Corporation (Symbol MSFT) So this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the January 2019 expiration for MSFT The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the $72 50 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3 05 Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4 2% return against the $72 50 commitment or a 3 7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ) Selling a put does not give an investor access to MSFT's upside potential the way owning shares would because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised So unless Microsoft Corporation sees its shares fall 13 5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $69 45 per share before broker commissions subtracting the $3 05 from $72 50) the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3 7% annualized rate of return Worth considering is that the annualized 3 7% figure actually exceeds the 2% annualized dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation by 1 7% based on the current share price of $83 78 And yet if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 13 46% to reach the $72 50 strike price Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that in general dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company In the case of Microsoft Corporation looking at the dividend history chart for MSFT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annualized dividend yield Turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the January 2019 expiration for shareholders of Microsoft Corporation (Symbol MSFT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2% annualized dividend yield Selling the covered call at the $95 strike and collecting the premium based on the $3 30 bid annualizes to an additional 3 5% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ) for a total of 5 5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away Any upside above $95 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but MSFT shares would have to advance 13 4% from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 17 3% return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Microsoft Corporation highlighting in green where the $72 50 strike is located relative to that history and highlighting the $95 strike in red The chart above and the stock's historical volatility can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Microsoft Corporation (considering the last 252 trading day MSFT historical stock prices using closing values as well as today's price of $83 78) to be 14% In mid-afternoon trading on Monday the put volume among S&P 500 components was 854 085 contracts with call volume at 1 49M for a put call ratio of 0 57 so far for the day Compared to the long-term median put call ratio of 65 that represents high call volume relative to puts in other words buyers are showing a preference for calls in options trading so far today Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today Top

NASDAQGS MSFT Does Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT) Recent Track Record Look Strong? Jenifer Prater November 27 2017 For long-term investors assessing earnings trend over time and against industry benchmarks is more beneficial than examining a single earnings announcement at a point in time Investors may find my commentary albeit very high-level and brief on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) useful as an attempt to give more color around how Microsoft is currently performing View our latest analysis for Microsoft Did MSFT beat its long-term earnings growth trend and its industry? I use the ‘latest twelve-month’ data which annualizes the latest 6-month earnings release or some times the latest annual report is already the most recent financial data This technique enables me to assess many different companies on a more comparable basis using the latest information For Microsoft the latest earnings is $22 113M which compared to the previous year’s figure has increased by 25 91% Since these figures are fairly nearsighted I’ve calculated an annualized five-year figure for Microsoft’s earnings which stands at $19 121M This shows that on average Microsoft has been able to steadily improve its bottom line over the past couple of years as well NasdaqGS MSFT Income Statement Nov 27th 17 What’s the driver of this growth? Well let’s take a look at whether it is solely owing to industry tailwinds or if Microsoft has seen some company-specific growth Over the past couple of years Microsoft top-line expansion has outstripped earnings and the growth rate of expenses Though this has caused a margin contraction it has moderated Microsoft’s earnings contraction Eyeballing growth from a sector-level the US software industry has been growing its average earnings by double-digit 18 12% over the past year and a more muted 7 70% over the past couple of years This means any tailwind the industry is benefiting from Microsoft is able to amplify this to its advantage What does this mean? While past data is useful it doesn’t tell the whole story Positive growth and profitability are what investors like to see in a company’s track record but how do we properly assess sustainability? I suggest you continue to research Microsoft to get a better picture of the stock by looking at 1 Future Outlook What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for MSFT’s future growth?

NASDAQGS MSFT Does Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT) Recent Track Record Look Strong? Jenifer Prater November 27 2017 For long-term investors assessing earnings trend over time and against industry benchmarks is more beneficial than examining a single earnings announcement at a point in time Investors may find my commentary albeit very high-level and brief on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) useful as an attempt to give more color around how Microsoft is currently performing View our latest analysis for Microsoft Did MSFT beat its long-term earnings growth trend and its industry? I use the ‘latest twelve-month’ data which annualizes the latest 6-month earnings release or some times the latest annual report is already the most recent financial data This technique enables me to assess many different companies on a more comparable basis using the latest information For Microsoft the latest earnings is $22 113M which compared to the previous year’s figure has increased by 25 91% Since these figures are fairly nearsighted I’ve calculated an annualized five-year figure for Microsoft’s earnings which stands at $19 121M This shows that on average Microsoft has been able to steadily improve its bottom line over the past couple of years as well NasdaqGS MSFT Income Statement Nov 27th 17 What’s the driver of this growth? Well let’s take a look at whether it is solely owing to industry tailwinds or if Microsoft has seen some company-specific growth Over the past couple of years Microsoft top-line expansion has outstripped earnings and the growth rate of expenses Though this has caused a margin contraction it has moderated Microsoft’s earnings contraction Eyeballing growth from a sector-level the US software industry has been growing its average earnings by double-digit 18 12% over the past year and a more muted 7 70% over the past couple of years This means any tailwind the industry is benefiting from Microsoft is able to amplify this to its advantage What does this mean? While past data is useful it doesn’t tell the whole story Positive growth and profitability are what investors like to see in a company’s track record but how do we properly assess sustainability?
