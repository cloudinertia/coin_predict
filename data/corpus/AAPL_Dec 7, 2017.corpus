Stop Selling iPhones Bernstein says the smartphone giant would make more money by leasing hardware By Wayne Duggan Contributor |Dec 7 2017 at 7 45 a m Why Apple Should Stop Selling iPhones An analyst envisions a future where Apple will lease iPhones iPads Macs and services such as iCloud and Apple Music Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images Most Apple Inc (Nasdaq AAPL) analysts agree that 2018 will be all about the iPhone X for Apple but some investors are already growing concerned about where the company will turn next to sustain its long-term growth According to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Apple could unlock major upside in its stock if it simply opts to transition to a subscription-based sales model [See 7 of the Best Tech Stocks to Buy for 2018 ] Sacconaghi says the timing has never been better for Apple to follow in the footsteps of Netflix (NFLX) Spotify and Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and push to transition its electronic personal device market to a subscription model "Customers could lease iPhones iPads Macs and services such as iCloud and Apple Music for one 'low' monthly fee and have their hardware upgraded after a certain number of years " Sacconaghi says according to CNBC The transition would help reassure investors of the stability of Apple's long-term business and could finally help Apple shed the hardware sales label that has weighed on its earnings multiple for years Without a change Sacconaghi says iPhone sales run the risk of suffering from the same elongated refresh cycles that have plagued iPad sales in 2017 If iPhone users start waiting longer to upgrade Berstein estimates iPhone sales could decline by up to 17 percent [See 7 Stocks Primed for an Amazon Buyout ] "By moving to a subscription model Apple would be able to lock in recurring revenue streams and freeze the length of replacement cycles likely leading to a material re-rating of its stock's multiple " Sacconaghi says But even if Apple doesn't pull the trigger on a subscription model Sacconaghi says the company is well-positioned heading into 2018 Apple could potentially benefit more than any other U S company from corporate tax reform Bernstein estimates Apple could get an immediate 18 percent boost to its earnings per share should the current Republican tax plan be implemented Apple has $252 billion in cash overseas and could save more than $47 billion in taxes on that cash if it chooses to bring it back into the U S at a 14 5 percent rate during the proposed repatriation holiday [See Which Companies Spend the Most on Lobbyists?] In addition Sacconaghi

Bruce Howe December 8 2017 Growth expectations for Apple Inc (NASDAQ AAPL) are high but many investors are starting to ask whether its last close at $169 01 can still be rationalized by the future potential There are some general checks that I have up my sleeve when I have uncertainties over the value a company is providing Let’s take a look at how AAPL stacks up against these Check out our latest analysis for Apple How is AAPL going to perform in the future? AAPL is covered by 35 analysts who by consensus are expecting earnings to increase from today’s level of $9 268 to $12 743 over the next couple of years This indicates a relatively solid earnings per share growth rate of 37 50% over the next few years which is an optimistic outlook in the near term Is AAPL’s share price justified by its earnings growth? Apple is available at price-to-earnings ratio of 18 24x showing us it is undervalued based on its latest annual earnings update compared to the technology hardware storage and peripherals average of 19 71x and undervalued relative to the current US market average of 19 32x NasdaqGS AAPL PE PEG Gauge Dec 8th 17 We already know that AAPL appears to be undervalued based on its PE ratio compared to the industry average But since Apple is a high-growth stock we must also account for its earnings growth by using calculation called the PEG ratio Based on Apple’s predicted 23 31% growth in earnings next year and PE ratio of 18 24x we see that Apple has a quite high PEG ratio of 2 63x This means that when we account for Apple’s growth the stock can be viewed as overvalued based on its fundamentals What this means for you Are you a shareholder? Since you may have already conducted your due diligence on AAPL the overvaluation of the stock may mean it is a good time to reduce your current holdings Although you should never overlook what intrinsic valuation models are telling you either Take a look at what valuation our discounted cash flow model is yielding Are you a potential investor? If you are considering investing in AAPL basing your decision on the PEG at one point in time is certainly not sufficient I recommend you do additional analysis by looking at the firm’s return on capital employed Click here to for a more in-depth analysis on these metrics TOP undervalued stocks for 2017 Looking for undervalued stocks?

(NASDAQ AAPL) Apple Accused Of Discrimination Apple has been accused of discriminating against small businesses with a heavy-handed attempt to crack down on App Store spam US Congressman Ted Lieu has written to Apple to complain about a recent change in App Store rules which prohibits apps from being developed using ready-made templates Although spammers and fraudsters have turned to templates to make it quicker and easier to launch apps the technique is also employed by smaller shops and restaurants as well as community organisations such as sports clubs schools and churches who cannot afford to develop an app from scratch Apple quietly changed its App Store guidelines in June to say that “apps created from a commercialised template or app generation service will be rejected” The iPhone maker has told developers it will be enforced starting on January 1 2018 despite complaints that it could make it harder for small businesses to compete with larger chain stores in mobile commerce

accused of discriminating against small businesses with a heavy-handed attempt to crack down on App Store spam US Congressman Ted Lieu has written to Apple to complain about a recent change in App

also employed by smaller shops and restaurants as well as community organisations such as sports clubs schools and churches who cannot afford to develop an app from scratch Apple quietly changed its App Store guidelines in June to say that “apps created from a commercialised template or app generation service will be rejected” The iPhone maker has told developers it will be enforced starting on January 1 2018 despite complaints that it could make it harder for small businesses to compete with larger chain stores in mobile commerce Apple Inc (Apple) designs manufactures and markets mobile

just named its favorite apps and games of the year (AAPL) Kif Leswing Dec 7 2017 12 33 PM Justin Edmonds/Getty Images Apple announced its apps of the year on Thursday The picks include two puzzle games and a meditation app These choices are based at least in part on the merits of the apps rather than exclusively on downloads Meditation photo editing and puzzles were the themes of the best apps of the year as determined by Apple employees The company on Thursday released its year-end list of top US apps for iPhones and iPads In addition to publishing the list of the most-downloaded apps and games Apple also chose an "app of the year" and a "game of the year" for both the iPhone and the iPad Apple's iPhone app of the year is Calm a health-and-fitness app that provides soundtracks and guides for meditation including routines to help you sleep It's free but many of its features are only available through in-app purchases or a subscription iTunes Apple's iPhone game of the year is Splitter Critters a creative and cute puzzler in which players navigate the game's two dimensional world by ripping it apart and pasting it back together The $2 99 game features a new augmented-reality mode iTunes The company's iPad app of the year is Affinity Photo a professional-level photo editing suite that can handle uncompressed RAW files and allows you to create an unlimited number of layers It costs $19 99 Apple's iPad game of the year is The Witness a beautiful single-person puzzle game It's $9 99 Company employees determine Apple's apps of the year Their picks are supposed to be based at least in part on the merits of the apps themselves rather than on how many downloads the apps have had or other business criteria The company determines its top apps on a per-country basis and picked different ones in other countries You can see the full US list here SEE ALSO STOCKS HIT A RECORD HIGH Here's what you need to know » READ NOW India is buying world's
