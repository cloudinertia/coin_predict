Research firm IHS Markit recently said "In the US iPhone X adoption after three weeks matched the adoption of iPhone 8 Plus and beat early adoption levels for both the iPhone 8 and 7 Plus Only the iPhone 7 model had greater initial success In Japan initial iPhone X adoption was as good as or better than any recent iPhone launch and matched the level of the iPhone 7 " Wait a minute "Only the iPhone 7 model had greater initial success " The iPhone 7 had greater initial success than the X? Let's look at how Apple did revenue-wise thanks to that "greater" 7 launch Source Apple quarterly releases You see above that the iPhone 7's early launch success was not enough to materialize into strong Apple year-over-year-sales growth That early launch success was "greater" than the iPhone X initial launch success Uh -9% Up 3% Call me crazy but I do not think that's what "super-cycle" hoping bulls are gunning for I think we all hope for better than +3% in the December quarter right? In fact the company guided December revenues to grow 7% to 11% Oh and that guide was so so nice because the quarter had one less week this year versus last year This year's December quarter will have 13 weeks versus last year's 14 weeks So really their 7-11% December revenue growth target implies a 14-18% growth target if you correct for the one less week One week on last year's 14 weeks is 1/14 = 7 14% Add that 7 14% to their 7-11% guide and you get = 14-18% growth underlying for the December quarter Their guide was Huge Huge Huge (Did I mention huge?)

US Carriers We recently spoke with T-Mobile (NASDAQ TMUS) investor contacts It does sound to us like they are benefiting from getting people through the door to check out the X But it didn't sound to us like consumers are overwhelmingly choosing the X That would agree with the above link showing 8 continuing its march higher despite that the just-launched X should be blowing it out It could be that the $1000 price tag is potentially a touch too high to be considered a mass-market product If so that would be way different than any other previous iPhone That changes things This is the biggest launch since US carriers moved away from subsidizing the phones in the monthly rates The price is also very high for carriers to discount too too much If the price proves that this is not a mass-market product then Apple's next few quarters' volume will be driven by 7 and 8 I don't think that's what super-cycle bulls are looking for Gross Margins Can they make it up in margins? We're not sure There is a ton of expensive content in these phones We're not sure that these phones will be higher margin than past phones In fact we are assuming down gross margins year over year That drags our earnings estimates to some degree Demand or margin drag can also affect the food chain of their major component suppliers Conclusion No doubt we love the iPhone X We were pumped about it when it was launched We were disappointed that it came late We were excited that there sounds like there's supply out there We're questioning though whether this can turn into the super-cycle bulls need in the near term Learn More About "Nail Tech Earnings" Our “buys” are outperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ and our “neutral” ratings by 2-3X We are speaking to many major tech companies each day and week We've been doing this for 20 years for big hedge funds Nail Tech Earnings' is also home to an amazing community of an elite group of traders portfolio managers and tech industry experts working collaboratively to identify “wow” earnings stories PS We're in a tech boom Know which stocks we think have the most potential upside If you care about tech stocks you can dip your toe in the water with a free trial Wishing you a ton of success!
