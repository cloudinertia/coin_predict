stock over the past couple of months Back in mid-September the shares were bumping up against resistance near $75 This was a long-term technical hurdle for MSFT and taking it out would mean considerable upside Before making a serious run at $75 MSFT stock regrouped at support from its 50-day moving average The shares bounced and entered a short-term bull run heading into earnings the week of Oct 27 Microsoft’s earnings were impressive blowing away the consensus estimate and pushing MSFT stock to fresh multi-year highs north of $80 Ahead of the event I offered up an options trading strategy for a Oct 27 $77/$77 50 bull call spread By my pre-market figures on Sept 19 the trade cost just 3 cents or $3 per pair of contracts Traders who got into this options trade were ultimately able to bank a maximum return of more than 1 400% — roughly $47 per contract With no earnings driver this time around returns won’t be quite as robust but I’m still looking at plenty of upside for

The 12-month price target meanwhile rests at $92 13 leaving room for potential price-target increases as analysts reasses their outlooks for 2018 Turning to the options pits pessimism dominates Microsoft’s January 2018 options backdrop Specifically the January 2018 put/call open interest ratio has risen to a reading of 1 72 as puts nearly double calls among back-month options That said many of these puts have been out there for a while and are likely tied to MSFT stock as a form of insurance January 2018 implieds meanwhile are pricing in a potential move of about 4 3% for Microsoft stock heading into expiration This places the upper bound at $88 50 with the lower bound coming in near $81 50 2 Trades for Microsoft Stock Call Spread The expected move this time isn’t as big and volatility is always a concern heading into a new year … so don’t expect a 1 400% return this time around Those looking to be bullish on MSFT stock might want to consider a Jan 2018 $87 50/$90 bull call spread At last check this spread was offered at 53 cents or $53 per pair of contracts Breakeven lies at $88 03 while a maximum profit of $1 97 or $197 per pair of contracts — a potential return of 271% — is possible if MSFT stock closes at or above $90 when January 2018 options expire Implieds are only pricing in a move to $88 50 so a maximum return might be a bit of a reach Be sure to set your stops according to your own expectations Put Sell If a more neutral-to-bullish stance is more your speed then a Jan 2018 $80 put sell position has an excellent chance at finishing out of the money At last check this put was bid at 39 cents or $39 per contract On the upside traders will keep the initial premium received as long as Microsoft stock closes above $80 when January 2018 options expire The downside is that should MSFT trade below $80 ahead of expiration traders could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $80 per share As of this writing Joseph Hargett did not

short-term upside Sentiment remains largely the same for Microsoft Thomson/First Call reports that 27 of the 34 analysts following MSFT stock rate the shares a “buy” or better — up from 25 out of 34 back in September The 12-month price target meanwhile rests at $92 13 leaving room for potential price-target increases as analysts reasses their outlooks for 2018 Turning to the options pits pessimism dominates Microsoft’s January 2018 options backdrop Specifically the January 2018 put/call open interest ratio has risen to a reading of 1 72 as puts nearly double calls among back-month options That said many of these puts have been out there for a while and are likely tied to MSFT stock as a form of insurance January 2018 implieds meanwhile are pricing in a potential move of about 4 3% for Microsoft stock heading into expiration This places the upper bound at $88 50 with the lower bound coming in near $81 50 2 Trades for Microsoft Stock Call Spread The expected move this time isn’t as big and volatility is always a concern heading into a new year … so don’t expect a 1 400% return this time around Those looking to be bullish on MSFT stock might want to consider a Jan 2018 $87 50/$90 bull call spread At last check this spread was offered at 53 cents or $53 per pair of contracts Breakeven lies at $88 03 while a maximum profit of $1 97 or $197 per pair of contracts — a potential return of 271% — is possible if MSFT stock closes at or above $90 when January 2018 options expire Implieds are only pricing in a move to $88 50 so a maximum return might be a bit of a reach Be sure to set your stops according to your own expectations Put Sell If a more neutral-to-bullish stance is more your speed then a Jan 2018 $80 put sell position has an excellent chance at finishing out of the money At last check this put was bid at 39 cents or $39 per contract On the upside traders will keep the initial premium received as long as Microsoft stock closes above $80 when January 2018 options expire The downside is that should MSFT trade below $80 ahead of expiration traders could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $80 per share As of this writing Joseph

Corporation (MSFT) stock price traded with surging change along with the volume 21 43 million shares on Monday trading session Shares are trading price at $85 23 with move of 1 27% The company’s 3-months average volume stands at 20 69 million When we divide the last trade volume by the 3-month average volume we found out a relative volume of 1 04 Current trade price levels places MSFT’s stock about -1 13% away from the 52-week high and closed 39 44% away from the 52-week low The total dollar value of all 7 74 billion outstanding shares is 659 83 billion Analysts recommendation for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Analysts have a consensus rating of 1 80 on the stock This is based on a 1-5 numeric scale where Rating Scale 1 0 Strong Buy 2 0 Buy 3 0 Hold 4 0 Sell 5 0 Strong Sell A buy rating is a recommendation to purchase a specific security A buy rating from an analyst or research firm is a recommendation to purchase the security with the implied insistence that the security is undervalued in some fashion Return on Assets (ROA) ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets The ROA is 9 70% A company that manages their assets well will have a high return while if manages their assets poorly will have a low return Common shareholders want to know how profitable their capital is in the businesses they invest it in The company gives a ROE of 29 20% The higher the ROE the better the company is at generating profits ROI is 11 70% A positive result means that returns exceed costs Analysts therefore consider the investment a net gain The opposite kind of result a negative means that costs outweigh returns Analysts therefore view the investment as a net loss Technical indicators of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Traders will often use multiple moving averages to analyze a single security Moving averages are a very simple tool to use like most technical indicators different traders will focus on different ways to use them A longer-term moving average may be used to identify the primary price trend a shorter moving average period to identify the secondary price trend and an even shorter moving average period to identify the minor price trend Typically 20-day simple moving average is useful at identifying swing trading trends lasting 20 days Shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longer-term moving averages However these more frequent signals may also result in more “whipsaws” resulting in erroneous trade signals Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) recently closed with rise of 2 34% to its 20-Day Simple Moving Average This short time frame picture represents an upward movement of current price over average price of last 20 days Now moving toward intermediate time frame 50-day Moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting 50 days Shares of MSFT moved upward with change of 5 39% to its 50-day Moving average This rising movement shows positive prices direction over last 50 days Finally observing long term time frame 200-day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting 200 days Longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals This will reduce the number of “whipsaws” which is good but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term averages MSFT stock price revealed optimistic move of 17 43% comparing average price of last 200 days This

Microsoft’s Windows phone BRAD STEPHENSON EMAIL @SHUTTLECOCK 20 HOURS AGO IN LATEST NEWS Continuum the Windows 10 Mobile feature that allows mobile apps to be run on a monitor via a wireless or wired adapter has been around for a while now but few companies have chosen to take advantage of it or use it to innovate new hardware creation as much as Miraxess who are using it as the main focus of their upcoming Mirabook laptop The Mirabook is based solely around the Continuum concept and essentially uses a Windows 10 Mobile Windows phone to power the laptop The device boasts a backlit keyboard up to 10 hours of battery life a 1080p 13 3 inch screen numerous ports (2 USB Type C 2 USB 3 0 1 HDMI 1 Audio Jack and 1 SD card extender) and an aluminum shell The user experience is very similar to connecting a Windows 10 Mobile smartphone to a larger monitor and connecting a dock and BlueTooth keyboard but all of these additional accessories are bundled together into the one laptop form factor which is significantly more convenient Users will only be able to use Continuum-enabled Windows 10 apps on the Mirabook but it’s also incredibly affordable when compared to full Windows 10 laptops with its price being set at as low as $249 It could be a legitimate option for a segment of the market who only need a laptop for basic tasks and are on a budget Units are expected to ship sometime in May 2018 Pre-orders are open now Do you like the idea of the Mirabook and would you buy one?

different story The lower the PEG ratio the more the stock may be undervalued given its earnings performance The degree to which a PEG ratio value indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type though a broad rule of thumb is that a PEG ratio below one is desirable Also the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used Using historical growth rates for

how much they have to pay for every $1 of earnings The formula for calculating the price-earnings ratio for any stock is simple the market value per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS) This is represented as the equation (P/EPS) where P is the market price and EPS is the earnings per share As the current market price of the stock is $85 63 and diluted EPS for the trailing twelve month is 2 96 the P/E ratio for the stock comes out as 28 83 Generally shareholders love stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio The perception is that the lower the P/E the higher will be the value of the stock The simple logic that a stock’s current market price does not justify (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind shareholders’ inclination toward low P/E stocks Price/Earnings to Growth – PEG Ratio Analysis The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period For now the company has PEG ratio of 2 73 The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock’s value while taking the company’s earnings growth into account and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio Despite the fact that a low P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy factoring in the company’s growth rate to get the stock’s PEG ratio can tell a different story The lower the PEG ratio the more the stock may be undervalued given its earnings performance The degree to which a PEG ratio value indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type though a broad rule of thumb is that a PEG ratio below one is desirable Also the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used Using historical growth rates for example may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are predictable to deviate from historical growth rates To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical

to get the stock’s PEG ratio can tell a different story The lower the PEG ratio the more the stock may be undervalued given its earnings performance The degree to which a PEG ratio value indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type though a broad rule of thumb is that a PEG ratio below one is desirable Also the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used Using historical growth rates for example may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are predictable to deviate from historical growth rates To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth the terms “forward PEG” and “trailing PEG” are sometimes used Stock’s Liquidity Analysis Stock’s Liquidity Analysis Presently 1 40% shares of Microsoft

for Tuesday Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) has grabbed attention from the analysts when it experienced a change of 1 27% in the last trading session to close at $85 23 A total of 21 434 432 shares exchanged hands during the intra-day trade contrast with its average trading volume of 20 69M shares while its relative volume stands at 1 04 Relative volume is the comparison of current volume to average volume for the same time of day and it’s displayed as a ratio If RVOL is less than 1 it is not In Play on this trading day and Investors may decide not to trade it If RVOL is above 2 it is In Play and this is more evidence Investors ought to be in the name When stocks are *very* In Play one can see a RVOL of 5 and above The higher the RVOL the more In Play the stock is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) Day traders strive to make money by exploiting minute price movements in individual assets (usually stocks though currencies futures and options are traded as well) usually leveraging large amounts of capital to do so therefore they trade on Stocks in Play In Play Stocks are volatile enough to produce good risk and reward trading opportunities for both bull and bear traders intraday Most company stocks have very little volatility They generally move extremely slowly and they only produce big price swings when the company produces good or bad trading results which may only happen a couple of times a year at best In deciding what to focus on – in a stock say – a typical day trader looks for three things liquidity volatility and trading volume Liquidity allows an investor to enter and exit a stock at a good price (i e tight spreads or the difference between the bid and ask price of a stock and low slippage or the difference between the predictable price of a trade and the actual price) If a stock does not have good liquidity then it may take some time before a broker is able to negotiate a deal to buy or sell a stock and the broker may not be able to get the sell or buy price that the trader is looking for This is a problem for day traders and it could mean the difference between a profitable and non-profitable trade Traders have different rules for what constitutes liquidity and a good guide is the volume of trades and volume of shares that are traded each day 100 000 shares traded per day would be a minimum for most traders and some require 1 000 000 Trading volume is a gauge of how many times a stock is bought and sold in a given time period (most commonly within a day of trading known as the average daily trading volume – ADTV) A high degree of volume indicates a lot of interest in a stock Often a boost in the volume of a stock is a harbinger of a price jump either up or down Volatility is simply a measure of the predictable daily price range—the range in which a day trader operates More volatility means greater profit or loss After a recent check Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) stock is found to be 1 63% volatile for the

of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) December 12 2017 EBU Staff Writer Wall Street analysts have the ability to provide stock ratings for companies that they track Based on analysts used by Zacks Research the present average broker rating on shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) is currently 1 64 This mean rating includes analysts who have offered Sell Buy and Hold ratings on the equity This rating lands on a numerical recommendation scale from 1 to 5 A score of 1 would represent a Buy recommendation and a score of 5 would indicate a Sell recommendation Out of all the analysts providing ratings 19 have rated the stock a Strong Buy or Buy based on data provided by Zacks Research With most major indexes showing strength it is safe to assume that many investors may have their heads in the clouds With many stocks frequently hitting new milestone highs investors may be scrambling to make sure that they aren’t missing out on possible returns Maybe some stocks have been doing well but others not in the portfolio have been doing much better There is rarely any substitute for hard work and dedication Investors may get complacent with stocks that they are familiar with Branching out into uncharted waters may help broaden the horizon and start the gears grinding for new trading ideas Traders and investors will no doubt be closely monitoring the markets as we move into the second half of the year It remains to be seen whether optimism or pessimism will rule going in to the next round of quarterly earnings reporting Zooming in on recent stock price action for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) we note that shares are trading near the 84 16 level Investors will often follow stock price levels in relation to the 52-week high and low levels The 52-week high is presently 84 88 and the 52-week low is sitting at 59 95 When a stock price is getting close to either the 52-week high or 52-week low investors may track activity to watch for a move past the established mark Over the last 12 weeks shares have seen a change of 12 56% Heading further back to the start of the year we note that shares have seen a change of 35 44% Focusing in closer to the last 4 weeks shares have seen a change of 0 08% Over the past five trading days the stock has changed -0 01% Sell-side Wall Street analysts will commonly offer stock price target estimates Many investors pay close attention to where the analysts project the stock moving in the future After a recent scan we can see that analysts polled by Zacks Research have set a consensus price target of $90 55 on shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) Price target estimates can be calculated using various methods and they may be quite different depending on the individual analyst A fully researched analyst report will generally provide detailed reasoning for a specific target price prediction Some investors may track analyst targets very closely and use the information to complement their own stock research Taking a quick look at the current quarter EPS consensus estimate for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) we can see that the most recent level is sitting at 0 86 This EPS projection uses 14 Sell-Side analysts polled by Zacks Research For the previous reported quarter the company posted a quarterly EPS of 0 84 Covering analysts have the tough job of following companies and offering future estimates These estimates are often closely followed on the Street and earnings beats or misses revolve around these projections Sometimes these predictions are extremely close to the actual reported number and other times they may be way off When a company posts actual earnings numbers the surprise factor can lead to sudden stock price fluctuations If a company meets and beats estimates and posts a positive earnings surprise the stock may see a near-term bump On the other end a negative surprise may send the stock in the opposite direction Many investors will choose to trade with caution around earnings releases and wait to make a move until after the major activity has subsided Investors may be trying to decide if the current market environment remains bullish It can be extremely difficult to decide when to sell especially when data seems positive and most signs are pointing higher Jumping in to buy stocks on a pullback may seem like a good idea but following specific sectors may become increasingly more important Following long-term trends may help the investor see the bigger picture of what has been going on with a specific stock or sector Deciding to sell a winner after a big run can be tempting but knowing the underlying causes for the run may help identify if there may indeed be more room for gains Avoiding common investing pitfalls may take

Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) we can see that the most recent level is sitting at 0 86 This EPS projection uses 14 Sell-Side analysts polled by Zacks Research For the previous reported quarter the company posted a quarterly EPS of 0 84 Covering analysts have the tough job of following companies and offering future estimates These estimates are often closely followed on the Street and earnings beats or misses revolve around these projections Sometimes these predictions are extremely close to the actual reported number and other times they may be way off When a company posts actual earnings numbers the surprise factor can lead to sudden stock price fluctuations If a company meets and beats estimates and posts a positive earnings surprise the stock may see a near-term bump On the other end a negative surprise may send the stock in the opposite direction Many investors will choose to trade with caution around earnings releases and wait to make a move until after the major activity has subsided Investors may be trying to decide if the current market environment remains bullish It can be extremely difficult to decide when to sell especially when data seems positive and most signs are pointing higher Jumping in to buy stocks on a pullback may seem like a good idea but following specific sectors may become increasingly more important Following long-term trends may help the investor see the bigger picture of what has been going on with a specific stock or sector Deciding to sell a winner after a big run can be tempting but knowing the underlying causes for the run may help identify if there may indeed be more room for gains Avoiding common investing pitfalls may take many years to master but it may end up determining long-term success LEAVE A COMMENT Following Analyst
