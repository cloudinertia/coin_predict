Microsoft Thomson/First Call reports that 27 of the 34 analysts following MSFT stock rate the shares a “buy” or better — up from 25 out of 34 back in September The 12-month price target meanwhile rests at $92 13 leaving room for potential price-target increases as analysts reasses their outlooks for 2018 Turning to the options pits pessimism dominates Microsoft’s January 2018 options backdrop Specifically the January 2018 put/call open interest ratio has risen to a reading of 1 72 as puts nearly double calls among back-month options That said many of these puts have been out there for a while and are likely tied to MSFT stock as a form of insurance January 2018 implieds meanwhile are pricing in a potential move of about 4 3% for Microsoft stock heading into expiration This places the upper bound at $88 50 with the lower bound coming in near $81 50 2 Trades for Microsoft Stock Call Spread The expected move this time isn’t as big and volatility is always a concern heading into a new year … so don’t expect a 1 400% return this time around Those looking to be bullish on MSFT stock might want to consider a Jan 2018 $87 50/$90 bull call spread At last check this spread was offered at 53 cents or $53 per pair of contracts Breakeven lies at $88 03 while a maximum profit of $1 97 or $197 per pair of contracts — a potential return of 271% — is possible if MSFT stock closes at or above $90 when January 2018 options expire Implieds are only pricing in a move to $88 50 so a maximum return might be a bit of a reach Be sure to set your stops according to your own expectations Put Sell If a more neutral-to-bullish stance is more your speed then a Jan 2018 $80 put sell position has an excellent chance at finishing out of the money At last check this put was bid at 39 cents or $39 per contract On the upside traders will keep the initial premium received as long as Microsoft stock closes above $80 when January 2018 options expire The downside is that should MSFT trade below $80 ahead of expiration traders could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $80 per share As of this writing Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities

preceded sizeable gains for MSFT the most recent augmented by earnings Click to Enlarge The shares have already rebounded from this support and have taken out resistance at $85 — an area that capped MSFT stock’s post-earnings rally With that technical hurdle out of the way the next area of resistance lies at $90 leaving nearly 6% in short-term upside Sentiment remains largely the same for Microsoft Thomson/First Call reports that 27 of the 34 analysts following MSFT stock rate the shares a “buy” or better — up from 25 out of 34 back in September The 12-month price target meanwhile rests at $92 13 leaving room for potential price-target increases as analysts reasses their outlooks for 2018 Turning to the options pits pessimism dominates Microsoft’s January 2018 options backdrop Specifically the January 2018 put/call open interest ratio has risen to a reading of 1 72 as puts nearly double calls among back-month options That said many of these puts have been out there for a while and are likely tied to MSFT stock as a form of insurance January 2018 implieds meanwhile are pricing in a potential move of about 4 3% for Microsoft stock heading into expiration This places the upper bound at $88 50 with the lower bound coming in near $81 50 2 Trades for Microsoft Stock Call Spread The expected move this time isn’t as big and volatility is always a concern heading into a new year … so don’t expect a 1 400% return this time around Those looking to be bullish on MSFT stock might want to consider a Jan 2018 $87 50/$90 bull call spread At last check this spread was offered at 53 cents or $53 per pair of contracts Breakeven lies at $88 03 while a maximum profit of $1 97 or $197 per pair of contracts — a potential return of 271% — is possible if MSFT stock closes at or above $90 when January 2018 options expire Implieds are only pricing in a move to $88 50 so a maximum return might be a bit of a reach Be sure to set your stops according to your own expectations Put Sell If a more neutral-to-bullish stance is more your speed then a Jan 2018 $80 put sell position has an excellent chance at finishing out of the money At last check this put was bid at 39 cents or $39 per contract On the upside traders will keep the initial premium received as long as Microsoft stock closes above $80 when January 2018 options expire The downside is that should MSFT trade below $80 ahead of expiration traders could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $80 per share As of this writing Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Technology Analysts recommend to Buy Technology Stock Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) By Paul Suggs - December 12 20170130 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock price traded with surging change along with the volume 21 43 million shares on Monday trading session Shares are trading price at $85 23 with move of 1 27% The company’s 3-months average volume stands at 20 69 million When we divide the last trade volume by the 3-month average volume we found out a relative volume of 1 04 Current trade price levels places MSFT’s stock about -1 13% away from the 52-week high and closed 39 44% away from the 52-week low The total dollar value of all 7 74 billion outstanding shares is 659 83 billion Analysts recommendation for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Analysts have a consensus rating of 1 80 on the stock This is based on a 1-5 numeric scale where Rating Scale 1 0 Strong Buy 2 0 Buy 3 0 Hold 4 0 Sell 5 0 Strong Sell A buy rating is a recommendation to purchase a specific security A buy rating from an analyst or research firm is a recommendation to purchase the security with the implied insistence that the security is undervalued in some fashion Return on Assets (ROA) ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets The ROA is 9 70% A company that manages their assets well will have a high return while if manages their assets poorly will have a low return Common shareholders want to know how profitable their capital is in the businesses they invest it in The company gives a ROE of 29 20% The higher the ROE the better the company is at generating profits ROI is 11 70% A positive result means that returns exceed costs Analysts therefore consider the investment a net gain The opposite kind of result a negative means that costs outweigh returns Analysts therefore view the investment as a net loss Technical indicators of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Traders will often use multiple moving averages to analyze a single security Moving averages are a very simple tool to use like most technical indicators different traders will focus on different ways to use them A longer-term moving average may be used to identify the primary price trend a shorter moving average period to identify the secondary price trend and an even shorter moving average period to identify the minor price trend Typically 20-day simple moving average is useful at identifying swing trading trends lasting 20 days Shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longer-term moving averages However these more frequent signals may also result in more “whipsaws” resulting in erroneous trade signals Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) recently closed with rise of 2 34% to its 20-Day Simple Moving Average This short time frame picture represents an upward movement of current price over average price of last 20 days Now moving toward intermediate time frame 50-day Moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting 50 days Shares of MSFT moved upward with change of 5 39% to its 50-day Moving average This rising movement shows positive prices direction over last 50 days Finally observing long term time frame 200-day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting 200 days Longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals This will reduce the number of “whipsaws” which is good but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term averages MSFT stock price revealed optimistic move of 17 43% comparing average price of last 200 days This

mobile apps to be run on a monitor via a wireless or wired adapter has been around for a while now but few companies have chosen to take advantage of it or use it to innovate new hardware creation as much as Miraxess who are using it as the main focus of their upcoming Mirabook laptop The Mirabook is based solely around the Continuum concept and essentially uses a Windows 10 Mobile Windows phone to power the laptop The device boasts a backlit keyboard up to 10 hours of battery life a 1080p 13 3 inch screen numerous ports (2 USB Type C 2 USB 3 0 1 HDMI 1 Audio Jack and 1 SD card extender) and an aluminum shell The user experience is very similar to connecting a Windows 10 Mobile smartphone to a larger monitor and connecting a dock and BlueTooth keyboard but all of these additional accessories are bundled together into the one laptop form factor which is significantly more convenient Users will only be able to use Continuum-enabled Windows 10 apps on the Mirabook but it’s also incredibly affordable when compared to full Windows 10 laptops with its price being set at as low as $249 It could be a legitimate option for a segment of the market who only need a laptop for basic tasks and are on a budget Units are expected to ship sometime in May 2018 Pre-orders are open now Do you like the idea of the Mirabook and would you buy one?
