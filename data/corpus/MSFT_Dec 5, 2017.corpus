MANAGED FX REAL ESTATE FEATURE COMPANIES SERVICES CALENDAR LIVE CHARTS Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) Further to Fall By HEFFX Australia on December 5 2017No Comment 5 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ MSFT) Further to Fall Overall the bias in prices is Sideways Short term Prices are stalling Intermediate term Prices are trending The projected upper bound is 84 23 The projected lower bound is 78 20 The projected closing price is 81 21 Candlesticks A big black candle occurred This is bearish as prices closed significantly lower than they opened If the candle appears when prices are “high ” it may be the first sign of a top If it occurs when prices are confronting an overhead resistance area (e g a moving average trendline or price resistance level) the long black candle adds credibility to the resistance Similarly if the candle appears as prices break below a support area the long black candle confirms the failure of the support area During the past 10 bars there have been 7 white candles and 3 black candles for a net of 4 white candles During the past 50 bars there have been 30 white candles and 20 black candles for a net of 10 white candles An engulfing bearish line occurred (where a black candle’s real body completely contains the previous white candle’s real body) The engulfing bearish pattern is bearish during an uptrend It then signifies that the momentum may be shifting from the bulls to the bears If the engulfing bearish pattern occurs during a downtrend (which appears to be the case with MICROSOFT CP) it may be a last engulfing bottom which indicates a bullish reversal The test to see if this is the case is if the next candle closes above the bottom the current (black) candle’s real body Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period Generally changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20) The Stochastic Oscillator is 33 4898 This is not an overbought or oversold reading The last signal was a sell 3 period(s) ago Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas The current value of the RSI is 42 83 This is not a topping or bottoming area A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area The last signal was a sell 12 period(s) ago Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas The current value of the CCI is -163 This is an oversold reading However a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100 The last signal was a sell 3 period(s) ago MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line The last

during Qualcomm’s Tech Summit keynote Microsoft and Qualcomm unveiled the first Always Connected PCs powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processors These type of PCs such as the ones from HP and ASUS are running Windows 10 on ARM and they can deliver all-day battery life better security and much more Microsoft’s Terry Myerson came on stage today to briefly talk about these Windows 10 on ARM PCs he later detailed the benefits of this new platform via a post on the Windows Experience Blog According to Myerson Always Connected PCs enable a new culture of work since they are instantly on provide great battery life and are always connected to the Internet The exec said that he already used a Windows 10 on ARM PC for watching movies working in Powerpoint and checking email and shared that he did “all of this without plugging in my power cord all week ” Here are the exec’s exact thoughts on the other benefits of Always Connected PCs This new Always Connected PC is ultrathin beautifully designed running Windows 10 and a new optimized version of Office 365 But beyond the full experiences you’d expect in a PC this new Always Connected PC has fundamentally transformed how I work because of three significant advantages over my other PCs The screen is instantly on whenever I pick up the device I never have to wait for it to wake up it’s just on Being always connected wherever I am whether I am in the car airport or coffee shop always being connected just feels like the most natural safe and secure way to work with teams and be creative Lastly the battery life is just awesome! I am finding myself charging it once a week When I was using a wearable that needed to charge every day I didn’t really rely on it Once I moved to a Fitbit that only needed charging once a week that was game changing for me Not carrying around power cords is liberating Always Connected PCs also have benefits for organizations and businesses including better security since they won’t need to connect to unsecured public WiFi networks Additionally these type of PCs can run either Windows 10 or Windows 10 S the first models from Asus and HP will actually run the more secure Windows 10 S out of the box but customers will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for free for a limited time The first Windows 10 on ARM PCs are expected to go to market in 2018 but we’ll likely see more of them at CES in January There is definitely a lot of excitement about Windows 10 on ARM right now but the first models won’t be based on Qualcomm’s latest and greatest silicon indeed the company also announced its new Snapdragon 845 processor today which will likely we found in all flagship Android smartphones next year Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 remains a very good processor today but we have yet to see how legacy Win32 apps such as Photoshop will work on these first Windows 10 on ARM PCs If the built-in x86 emulator in Windows 10 on ARM can really deliver performance that matches what we find on PCs with Intel and AMD processors then Microsoft and its OEM partners can well have a hit on their hands Tweet thisFacebook ShareShare on RedditPost to Pinterest Further reading Always Connected PC Microsoft Qualcomm Windows 10 Windows 10 on ARM Will you be buying a Windows 10 on ARM PC next year?
