hot-and-cold sales cycle of boxed software to a business model that drives steady recurring revenue It takes some major memory recall but older investors will remember the thrill of the revenue rise linked to the release of a new Windows operating system or Office productivity suite and then the anxiety of not knowing how quickly sales would drop off once the initial wave of buying ran its course The company always had a new operating system in the works but they only became available every two or three years That’s not the case anymore The cloud has set the stage for recurring revenue with many users effectively renting access to Microsoft Office rather than paying a hefty fee once every few years Although software-as-a-service is generally lower-margin revenue it’s still far more predictable Bottom Line for MSFT Stock For the old-timers who can remember this far back yes Windows 95 (and arguably Windows 3 0) weren’t exactly uncommon back in their day It wasn’t until the late 90’s however that personal computers became cheap enough to make them affordable for the masses It also wasn’t until the late-90’s and even the early 2000’s that broadband internet made computers practical enough to bother owning one for most people Ergo Windows 98 was the system most computer users cut their teeth on after its May-1998 launch That’s why it’s still one of the most beloved platforms even if it’s now obsolete Regardless of which early version of Windows is the one you know and love it’s shocking to look back and see just how much its maker Microsoft has changed in the meantime This is most definitely not the MSFT stock of yesteryear … not that anyone’s complaining Indeed all the changes were necessary for the company’s continued success Still what a journey rife with changes nobody would have foreseen then As of this writing James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities You can follow him on Twitter at @jbrumley All companies

wasn’t until the late 90’s however that personal computers became cheap enough to make them affordable for the masses It also wasn’t until the late-90’s and even the early 2000’s that broadband internet made computers practical enough to bother owning one for most people Ergo Windows 98 was the system most computer users cut their teeth on after its May-1998 launch That’s why it’s still one of the most beloved platforms even if it’s now obsolete Regardless of which early version of Windows is the one you know and love it’s shocking to look back and see just how much its maker Microsoft has changed in the meantime This is most definitely not the MSFT stock of yesteryear … not that anyone’s complaining Indeed all the changes were necessary for the company’s continued success Still

software business In 2013 though when it became clear that cloud computing was the future the duo teamed up By combining the best of both each company has remained a relevant fierce competitor at

knowing how they might be spun into a marketable product The company’s foray into the realm of artificial intelligence is one example As yours truly noted back in early September the acquisition of Toronto-based A I software firm Maluuba was interesting but Maluuba’s only claim to fame thus far was an intelligence that plays video games It’s not exactly clear how the technology could be put to revenue-bearing use Doesn’t matter When the time is right and the technology is ready Nadella will find a way to monetize it noted back in early September 3 Recurring Revenue Last but not least perhaps one of the most exciting changes MSFT stock holders have witnessed over the years is a migration from the hot-and-cold sales cycle of boxed software to a business model that drives steady recurring revenue It takes some major memory recall but older investors will remember the thrill of the revenue rise linked to the release of a new Windows operating system or Office productivity suite and then the anxiety of not knowing how quickly sales would drop off once the initial wave of buying ran its course The company always had a new operating system in the works but they only became available every two or three years That’s not the case anymore The cloud has set the stage for recurring revenue with many users effectively renting access to Microsoft Office rather than

Reuters Dec 6 2017 01 57 PM By Julia Fioretti and Lily Cusack Dec 6 (Reuters) - Internet groups such as Facebook Google's YouTube and Twitter need to do more to stem the proliferation of extremist content on their platforms the European Commission said after a meeting on Wednesday Social media companies have significantly boosted their resources to take down violent and extremist content as soon as possible in response to growing political pressure from European governments particularly those hit by militant attacks in recent years But Julian King EU security commissioner said that while a lot of progress had been made additional efforts were needed "We are not there yet We are two years down the road of this journey to reach our final destination we now need to speed up our work " King said in his closing speech at the third meeting of the EU Internet Forum which brings together the Commission EU member states law enforcement and technology companies The EU has said it will come forward with legislation next year if it is not satisfied with progress made by tech companies in removing extremist content while a German online hate speech law comes into effect on Jan 1 The Commission is keen to avoid a patchwork of national laws on the issue and favours a self-regulatory approach Over the summer Microsoft Facebook Twitter and YouTube formed a global working group to combine their efforts in removing extremist content from their platforms and last year formed a database of known "terrorist" images and videos which now contains more than 40 000 hashes or digital signatures On Wednesday the members of the Internet Forum presented a report with updates on progress made by companies and Europol in detecting and removing extremist content online The report reviewed by Reuters encourages the companies to remove "new and historical terrorist content and to develop solutions to identify and remove terrorist content within 1-2 hours of upload to the extent it is technically feasible without compromising human rights and fundamental freedoms " The Commission wants companies to use automatic detection technologies more and act faster on referrals from member states and Europol "It is feasible to reduce the time it takes to remove content to a few hours " said Dimitris Avramopoulos EU home affairs commissioner "There is a lot of room for improvement for this cooperation to produce even better results starting with the reporting from the companies which must become more regular and more transparent " Facebook last week reported progress in removing extremist content from its platform saying it was removing 99 percent of content related to militant groups Islamic State and al Qaeda before being told of it although it did not say how many items it was removing (Reporting by Julia Fioretti Editing by Mark Potter) SEE ALSO STOCKS HIT A RECORD HIGH Here's what you need to know » READ NOW India is buying world's emptiest airport in its

Windows PCs 11 recent stories 11 recent stories 11 recent stories New study shows that more and more schools are choosing Windows PCs LAURENT GIRET EMAIL @ 6 DAYS AGO IN LATEST NEWS Over the past couple of years Microsoft has been facing strong competition from Apple and Google in the education market Last year more than 50% of mobile PCs sold in the US EDU market were Chromebooks something that caught many by surprise The fact is Chrome OS is no longer a handicap for Chromebooks which are easy to manage for IT admins Moreover many Chromebooks now support the Google Play Store (including Microsoft’s Office Android) making them as versatile as a Windows PC for most students Microsoft has been taking Chromebooks very seriously though and the company has been working hard to make sure that Windows PCs remain an attractive option in the EDU sector Citing Futuresource’s latest quarterly report Yusuf Mehdi Corporate Vice President Windows and Devices Group said that the rise of Chromebooks in the education market didn’t prevent Windows PCs from seeing solid growth in the US as well as the rest of the world last year In K-12 schools in the US in the last year Windows device share grew 4 3 percent on devices under $300 and 8 2 percent on devices over $300 as more and more schools are choosing Windows over competitive offerings Globally we also saw large sales increases in markets like India and Argentina where hundreds of thousands of students will soon be unlocking limitless learning potential on new Windows devices This year we saw Microsoft and its partners launch affordable (sub $300) Windows laptops for the education market which are easily manageable with InTune for Education The Redmond giant also introduced Windows 10 S during an education-focused event in May which was followed by the release of a new classroom experience in Microsoft Teams According to Mike Fisher Associate Director at Futuresource Consulting Microsoft is now pretty well-positioned to take advantage of the next PC replacement cycle in the EDU market “Q3 2017 was the first time we saw and heard about a slight shifting of the competitive scenario in the US with many OEMs and major channel players reporting faster growth (and expected growth) on Windows than Chrome based devices ” he explained wondering if Microsoft will really be able to accelerate this trend in 2018 “The majority of market demand is expected to be replacement demand convincing existing Chrome users to completely change the existing ecosystem will likely not be easy due to the time and cost involved ”

in the US In K-12 schools in the US in the last year Windows device share grew 4 3 percent on devices under $300 and 8 2 percent on devices over $300 as more and more schools are choosing Windows over competitive offerings Globally we also saw large sales increases in markets like India and Argentina where hundreds of thousands of students will soon be unlocking limitless learning potential on new Windows devices In K-12 schools in the US in the last year Windows device share grew 4 3 percent on devices under $300 and 8 2 percent on devices over $300 as more and more schools are choosing Windows over competitive offerings Globally we also saw large sales increases in markets like India and Argentina where hundreds of thousands of students will soon be unlocking limitless learning potential on new Windows devices This year we saw Microsoft and its partners launch affordable (sub $300) Windows laptops for the education market which are easily manageable with InTune for Education The Redmond giant also introduced Windows 10 S during an education-focused event in May which was followed by the release of a new classroom experience in Microsoft Teams launch affordable (sub $300) Windows laptops for the education market introduced Windows 10 S new classroom experience in Microsoft Teams According to Mike Fisher Associate Director at Futuresource Consulting Microsoft is now pretty well-positioned to take advantage of the next PC replacement cycle in the EDU market “Q3 2017 was the first time we saw and heard about a slight shifting of the competitive scenario in the US with many OEMs and major channel players reporting faster growth (and expected growth) on Windows than Chrome based devices ” he explained wondering if Microsoft will really be able to accelerate this trend in 2018 “The majority of market demand is expected to be replacement demand convincing existing Chrome users to completely change the existing ecosystem will likely not be easy due to the time and cost involved ” he added Tweet thisFacebook ShareShare on RedditPost to Pinterest Tweet thisFacebook ShareShare on RedditPost to Pinterest Tweet thisFacebook ShareShare on RedditPost to Pinterest

Earnings Investors see Higher earnings in the future Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) By Danielle Lockwood - December 6 2017051 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock price traded Upswing on volume of 25 65 million shares in recent session Shares are clocking price at $81 59 with change of 0 63% The company’s 3-months average volume stands at 20 24 million When we divide the last trade volume by the 3-month average volume we found out a relative volume of 1 27 Currently Analysts have a mean recommendation of 1 80 on the shares Current trade price levels places MSFT’s stock about -5 35% away from the 52-week high and closed 36 99% away from the 52-week low The total dollar value of all 7 64 billion outstanding shares is 623 23 billion The beta factor is 0 99 Volatility shows sense of how far the stock will fall if the market takes a dive and how high stock will rise if the bull starts to climb A stock with a beta more than 1 means high volatile and less than 1 means low volatile Price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio Analysis about Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock analysis is based on price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio P/E tells more about the company current situation and future performance The price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio helps investors analyze how much they should pay for a stock based on its current earnings This is why the price to earnings ratio is often called a price multiple or earnings multiple Investors use this ratio to decide what multiple of earnings a share is worth In other words how many times earnings they are willing to pay As the P/E goes up it shows that current investor sentiment is that the company is worth more Price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is 27 60 MSFT has price to earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 2 61 and Forward P/E of 21 61 Companies with higher future earnings are usually expected to issue higher dividends or have appreciating stock in the future Obviously fair market value of a stock is based on more than just predicted future earnings Investor speculation and demand also help increase a share’s price over time The price to earnings ratio indicates the expected price of a share based on its earnings As a company’s earnings per share being to rise so does their market value per share A company with a high P/E ratio usually indicated positive future performance and investors are willing to pay more for this company’s shares Note The price-to-earnings ratio is a powerful but limited tool For investors it allows a very quick snapshot of the company’s finances without getting bogged down in the details of an accounting report Therefore P/E ratio should be used cautiously Investment decisions should not be based solely on the P/E ratio It is better to use it in conjunction with other ratios and measures Trend Direction of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Typically 20-day simple moving average is useful at identifying swing trading trends lasting 20 days Shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longer-term moving averages However these more frequent signals may also result in more “whipsaws” resulting in erroneous trade signals Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) recently closed with fall of -2 41% to its 20-Day Simple Moving Average This short time frame picture represents a downward movement of current price over average price of last 20 days Now moving toward intermediate time frame 50-day Moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting 50 days Shares of MSFT moved upward with change of 1 81% to its 50-day Moving average This rising movement shows positive prices direction over last 50 days Finally observing long term time frame 200-day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting 200 days Longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals This will reduce the number of “whipsaws” which is good but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term averages MSFT stock price revealed optimistic move of 12 99% comparing average price of last 200 days This comparison showed up direction of price above its 200-SMA Common shareholders want to know how profitable their capital is in the businesses they invest it in The company gives a ROE of 29 20% The higher the ROE the better the company is at generating profits Return on Assets (ROA) ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets The ROA is 9 70% A company that manages their assets well will have a high return while if manages their assets poorly will have a low return ROI is 11 70% A positive result means that returns exceed costs Analysts therefore consider the investment a net gain The opposite kind of result a negative means
